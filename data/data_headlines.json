        "1": "Some of the world\u2019s biggest companies and deepest-pocketed investors are lining up trillions of dollars to finance a shift away from fossil fuels.\n\nAssets in investment funds focused partly on the environment reached almost $2 trillion globally in the first quarter, more than tripling in three years. Investors are putting $3 billion a day into these funds. More than $5 billion worth of bonds and loans designed to fund green initiatives are now issued every day. The two biggest U.S. banks pledged $4 trillion in climate-oriented financing over the next decade.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve reached the tipping point and beyond,\u201d said James Chapman, chief financial officer at Dominion Energy Inc., one of the country\u2019s biggest utilities. Dominion, which has begun issuing green bonds, is planning to spend $26 billion or more on clean energy such as wind and solar in the next five years.\n\nAfter years of intermittent excitement followed by fizzled expectations, green finance is now looking less like the niche interest of socially conscious investors and more like a sustainable gold rush. Driven by surging valuations for electric-vehicle companies such as Tesla Inc. and startup battery producers, banks and investors are betting the transition from fossil fuels is here to stay, and that they can make money by getting behind it, further entrenching the shift.\n\nBehind the geyser of capital is a confluence of forces. Big money managers see opportunities for substantial profits, and they also worry about financial risks associated with climate change.

        "2": "Wednesday\u2019s huge sell-off in the cryptocurrency market saw a wide range of coins and tokens lose between 30% and 50% of their value in a few hours as indiscriminate selling shattered the market\u2019s previously bullish sentiment. The near $1 trillion sell-off, sparked by fears of a further clampdown on cryptocurrency usage in China, and negative tweets from Tesla\u2019s Elon Musk, wiped out weeks, and in some cases months, worth of gains, with leveraged accounts trying to unwind long positions adding fuel to fire. The market has pared back some of these losses but sentiment remains weak and it will take a long time to return back to the heady times of earlier this year, if at all. The current extreme levels of volatility and weak sentiment do not make good bedfellows.\n\nOvernight news that the US Treasury Department wants new rules put in place, requiring cryptocurrency exchanges to report transactions over $10,000, has not helped sentiment. The move, part of President Biden\u2019s upgraded measures to prevent tax avoidance, would likely come into force in 2023 if agreed.\n\nBitcoin, an underperformer over the last few months, especially against Ethereum, is stabilizing around $41,000 after touching a flash-low of $30,000 on Wednesday. The sell-off wick on Wednesday\u2019s candle has now been recovered, but it is difficult to know how much of the heavy two-week sell-off from $60,000 can be recouped. The weekend can be a volatile period for cryptocurrencies, with volume usually lower than during the week, so it may be wise for traders to wait and see where BTC is on Monday before making any decisions.\n\nJOMO is the New FOMO: Trade with the Joy of Missing Out\n\nEthereum has a similar chart pattern to Bitcoin over the last 3 days and has also given back a chunk of its recent outperformance against its peer. The ETH/BTC spread started the year around the 230 level and rallied all the way up to a peak of 812 last Friday. The pair now trades around 662 after touching a sell-off low of 608 on Thursday.\n\nThe alt-coin market also sustained very heavy losses mid-week with a host of the current market favorites, including Cardano (ADA), Dogecoin (DOGE) and newcomer Internet Computer (ICP), all hammered. This sector will find it even harder than the more established coins to recover.\n\nTraders of all levels and abilities will find something to help them make more informed decisions in the new and improved DailyFX Trading Education Centre\n\nWhat are your views on Bitcoin (BTC),Ethereum (ETH) \u2013 bullish or bearish??

        "5": "Eligible families will start receiving the enhanced child tax credit payments on July 15. If you're expecting a payment, see how much you'll get here. Before the IRS can send those payments, however, it will open two portals for people with qualifying dependents to make any necessary changes. The portals will also be used to opt out of the monthly payments if you'd rather get one large check, and help make sure you're registered if you don't normally file a tax return. We'll explain all the details below.\n\nThe child tax credit 2021 payments will go out on the 15th day of the month, with checks as much as $300 per child each month or $3,600 in total, depending on your children's age by the end of the year. Note that there's an income limit you must meet in order to get the full payment.\n\nWe'll tell you everything we know so far about the separate IRS portals -- and what we don't yet know. Here are some different ways to use your child tax credit checks and how you may receive your payment. Here's how you can claim an additional $8,000 to $16,000 credit for child care expenses.\n\nWhat can you do with the IRS' online child tax credit portal?\n\nTaxpayer families will be able to make changes to any life circumstances since they last filed their taxes, such as an income change and child custody status. For example, if you started making less money this year, you'll want to update the IRS about those changes so you can get the correct child tax credit amount.\n\nIf you had or will have a new baby this year, it's important to let the IRS know, so you can receive your payment for up to $3,600 for that child. The same applies if you adopted a child or if you gained a new child dependent since you last filed your taxes.\n\nAlso, if you've gained full custody of your child, you'll be the parent who receives the money for your kid. Note that parents who have shared custody will not each get a payment. This is important for domestic violence survivors, Nina Olson, executive director of the Center for Taxpayer Rights said during an IRS oversight hearing. \"That change of circumstances portal should allow them to enter their change in marital status and also where the children are.\"\n\nCan I use one of the child tax credit portals to opt out of the monthly payments?\n\nThe main portal mentioned above will also let you opt out of receiving the monthly child tax credit payments. What does that mean? It means that instead of receiving monthly payments of, say, $300 for your 4-year-old child, you can wait until you file your 2021 taxes next year to receive the $3,600 lump sum amount.\n\nYou may also want to opt out because you're expecting your circumstances to change and don't want to update your information in the portal.\n\nWhat if I don't typically file my taxes?\n\nThe IRS will open a second portal dedicated to people who don't typically file their income taxes. This child tax credit portal will allow this group to give the IRS their updated information, including the number and ages of their qualifying child dependents.\n\nThe portal is expected to let tax nonfilers submit a simplified electronic form to the IRS, to secure their eligibility. This group would include people who don't have bank accounts, and the homeless population.\n\nHow to help those who don't have a permanent address at this time\n\nRight now, the IRS is urging people to share information about the child tax credit to those who don't have permanent addresses. By doing this, you're helping make sure eligible people receive the payments they're eligible for. You can share the information about the portals with them so they know about the programs to help them file a tax return.\n\nWhen will the child tax credit portals open for eligible families?\n\nThe IRS has set an open date by July 1, though we don't have an exact target date yet. The portals could come online sooner than that. The IRS is simultaneously processing tens of millions of tax returns, which may affect the timeline while it also organizes the child tax credit program.\n\nWhat we don't know about the child tax credit portals right now\n\nThere are still plenty of details that are still unclear about the IRS' child tax credit portals, including:\n\u2022 The exact date the portals will be available to families.\n\u2022 How the portals will work for families updating their information.\n\u2022 How families will differentiate between the two portals.\n\u2022 The process for opting out of the monthly payments.\n\nFor more child tax credit 2021 details, here's how much money you can expect to get. Also, here's what it takes for you and your dependents to qualify for the payments.",

        "8": "International shipping is currently a bit of a mess, but thanks to some costly updates in infrastructure, ports on the U.S. East Coast are now able to receive ships like the CMA CGM Marco Polo, which arrived in New York City on Thursday. Almost the size of the Ever Given that got stuck in the Suez Canal, the Marco Polo is the largest ship to ever visit the American East Coast ports.\n\n\n\nEven before everyone\u2019s favorite cargo ship, the Ever Given, blocked the Suez Canal back in March, ports were overwhelmed and the cost of shipping containers skyrocketed. Now that manufacturing is ramping up from its COVID-19 delay, space in shipping containers comes at a dear price. From Bloomberg:\n\nThe super-charged rally in commodity prices has made shipping more expensive than any time in the past decade, reviving the fortunes of an industry that was on its knees just a year ago. The scale of the boom, with red-hot demand almost everywhere on the back of a broad economic recovery and vast stimulus programs, has stretched global shipping as products such as soybeans and logs compete with traditional cargo mainstays of coal and iron ore. The surge also highlights the pressures the commodities industry is under to meet that growth.\ufeff\n\n\n\nMore expensive shipping means bigger ships can make a ton of money by moving more goods, making mega ships like the Marco Polo or yes, the Ever Given, gold mines for their owners and a prayer answered for companies looking to move stuff. Still, there have been delays, not only because of the volume of goods moving around the world, but due to natural disasters like overloaded cargo ships losing record amounts of containers in historic storms or the Ever Given beaching itself and blocking the Suez Canal for six days in March during an intense wind storm.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until recently that East Coast ports could even handle ships like the Marco Polo, because of how high they stack their containers. From the Associated Press:\n\nWhile Los Angeles has been able to accommodate ships that can carry the equivalent of 23,000 20-foot containers \u2014 a cargo unit known as a TEU \u2014 Atlantic ports still can\u2019t handle boats that big. As recently as four years ago a ship the size of the Marco Polo would have bypassed the ports of New Jersey and New York because the Bayonne Bridge, which connects New Jersey and Staten Island, was too low and the port system\u2019s waterways were too shallow.\n\n Spurred by the expansion of the Panama Canal last decade that allowed larger ships to pass through, New Jersey/New York and other East Coast ports scrambled to capitalize.\n\n The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey spent nearly $2 billion to raise the bridge by 64 feet, a feat that required keeping the existing roadway until a higher roadway was built on top of it; a separate project costing about the same amount deepened the channel in New York harbor. Savannah\u2019s port, the fourth-busiest container port in the country, is in the final stages of a six-year, roughly $1 billion project to deepen the shipping channel.

Industry observers believed Gates was overly arrogant during his testimony, and the government eventually reined in Microsoft's power in a landmark antitrust lawsuit.\n\nSince then, Gates has tried to shed his reputation as a cocky tech mogul, instead crafting a public image of a nerdy do-gooder, largely through his philanthropy.\n\nBut since Gates and his wife, Melinda French Gates, announced their plans to divorce, reports about his conduct toward female coworkers and his relationship with the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein have chipped away at that image.\n\nThese allegations have come from a variety of sources and mention incidents dating back years before the divorce announcement, suggesting Gates' private reputation has long diverged from the image he's portrayed publicly.\n\nHere are all the times Gates has been accused of questionable behavior.",

Russell 's dramedy, Cooper stars opposite Jennifer Lawrence as a man with bipolar disorder who moves back into his parents house.\n\nHollywood dealmaking has failed to save the industry\u2019s top talent from a studio\u2019s bankruptcy.\n\nThat\u2019s the lesson from a precedential opinion out on Friday from the 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals, which reviewed what happened after the downfall of Harvey Weinstein. Unfortunately for many stars, millions of dollars in continent compensation from hit movies now seems all but lost forever.\n\nAfter Weinstein was credibly accused of sexual misconduct, his eponymous company filed for bankruptcy protection. Then in early 2019, Spyglass Media (then called Lantern) came to a deal to acquire most of Weinstein\u2019s assets for $289 million. But did Spyglass first have to pay Weinstein\u2019s old debts before taking over contracts that would give them rights to many films and TV shows? That\u2019s what Hollywood\u2019s creatives including Bradley Cooper, Jennifer Lawrence, Robert De Niro, Meryl Streep, Bill Murray and Julia Roberts insisted.\n\nSpyglass felt otherwise. According to the company, these contracts weren\u2019t executory, meaning that obligations from the parties had already been substantially performed. The debts didn\u2019t transfer in the Weinstein bankruptcy sale. To confirm it, Spyglass brought a test case against Silver Linings Playbook producer Bruce Cohen, who got five percent of the celebrated movie\u2019s net profits and was owed $400,000 at the time of the bankruptcy.\n\nSpyglass won the test case \u2014 and then prevailed in the first appellate round to the chagrin of Hollywood\u2019s above-the-line guilds which warned of consequences.\n\nNow comes yet another victory for Spyglass \u2014 and barring any rehearing by the 3rd Circuit or intervention by the Supreme Court, this one could become the final determination.\n\n\u201cAt a high level, the essence of the Cohen Agreement was for Cohen to produce the Picture in exchange for money,\u201d writes Circuit Judge Thomas Ambro. \u201cThus, he contributed almost all his value when he produced the movie. At the time of TWC\u2019s bankruptcy, the Picture had been released for six years and Cohen had not done any further work on it.\u201d\n\nCohen\u2019s remaining obligations like indemnification were \u201cancillary after-thoughts in a production agreement,\u201d Ambro adds.\n\nOK, but what about the money owed? Surely, paying up is a material obligation of the contract.\n\nAmbro responds by rolling through the distinction between a covenant and termination provision before ultimately concluding, \u201c[I]f we accept Cohen\u2019s argument, then the parties also overrode protections in the Bankruptcy Code\u2026Here, the logical implication of Cohen\u2019s position is that the Cohen Agreement would be an executory contract forever, no matter how much he has already performed. That would be a highly unusual result and would contravene the protections created for the Debtors by the Bankruptcy Code.\u201d\n\nThe appeals court decides the $400,000 in contingent compensation owed to Cohen does not need to be paid. The same is almost assuredly true for others involved in Silver Linings Playbook including Bradley Cooper and Robert De Niro, although Spyglass will have to pay any net profits the movie makes from here on out. But as for what was lost, Ambro writes, \u201cThis pill is bitter to swallow, but bankruptcy inevitably creates harsh results for some players.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s the ruling in the Cohen case\u2026",
        "14": "Just like its upcoming test flight this weekend, Virgin Galactic Holdings (NYSE:SPCE) stock is positioned for a powerful liftoff. One analyst tracking the stock, UBS' (NYSE:UBS) Myles Walton, upgraded his recommendation on the stock Friday to buy from neutral. That was despite the prognosticator's price target cut; to him, it's now worth $36 per share, instead of $40.\n\nEven with that chop, Virgin Galactic still has significant upside. Walton's new level implies a gain of almost 71% on the most recent closing stock price.\n\nInvestors are bullish on Virgin Galactic just now mainly because of that test flight, the scheduling of which was confirmed by the company Thursday.\n\nWalton is encouraged by this and finds another key reason to be positive on Virgin Galactic. \"We think the faster pace of the Blue Origin offering commercial service merits watching, but we're also encouraged by the care being taken on pricing and price discovery in the near-term (as illustrated by the [roughly] $3 [million] current bid price for the first Blue Origin seat with 3 weeks left of bidding).\"\n\nBlue Origin is the commercial space tourism company launched by Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) founder and CEO Jeff Bezos. Earlier this week, the Amazon honcho's company unveiled the results of the auction for its first space ticket, and the leading bid was a whopping $2.4 million.\n\nAs a result, \"We remain positive on the fundamentals of the [Virgin Galactic] offering as well as the scarcity of the experience provided to customers,\" Walton wrote.\n\nAlthough it's early days, the twin effects of the new test flight and the robust demand for that space flight ticket are putting some real zip into Virgin Galactic's shares. Walton's hopeful note also helps. On Friday, the company's stock closed 6.4% higher.",
        "15": "Pope Francis, who has frequently spoken out on environmental issues, will trade in his popemobile for a new model running entirely on battery power.\n\nThe pontiff met Thursday with Henrik Fisker and Geeta Gupta-Fisker, founders of the California-based electric car startup Fisker, who provided him with renderings of the vehicle they plan to deliver during the fourth quarter of next year. It will be based on the Fisker Ocean SUV the company plans to put in production in 2022.\n\n\"I got inspired reading that Pope Francis is very considerate about the environment and the impact of climate change for future generations,\" Henrik Fisker said in a statement.\n\nThe connection to the pope, Fisker told NBC News by email, was made through \u201ca mutual friend [who] arranged the meeting.\u201d\n\nThis is the second zero-emission vehicle that the Argentine-born pope will receive. Last year, Japanese automaker Toyota delivered a specially customized version of its Mirai fuel-cell vehicle. It\u2019s currently one of three hydrogen-powered vehicles on the market. The Toyota popemobile has not seen extensive use, however, largely due to the challenges of finding a readily accessible source of the lightweight gas during the pontiff\u2019s travels.\n\nTraditionally, popes have traveled in vehicles provided to the Holy See by Mercedes-Benz, with the first presented to Pope Pius XI in 1930. Recent models have included transparent compartments where the pope can stand up while also keeping him safe. That became essential following an assassination attempt on Pope John Paul II in May 1981 in St. Peter\u2019s Square.\n\nFor his part, the current pope has maintained a low profile when it comes to the vehicles he travels in, preferring to use Fords, Jeeps and Fiats.\n\nConsidering the environmentally friendly nature of the Fisker product, and the fact that Francis met with the company founders, there\u2019s a good chance it will find more use than Toyota\u2019s popemobile once it is delivered.\n\nThe design is based on the Ocean, the first product Fisker plans to bring to market. Currently, it is set to go into production at a factory in Austria on Nov. 17.\n\nSeveral configurations will be offered to the public, including one capable of running 300 miles between charges. A base model with more limited range is expected to come in at $37,499 in the United States before applying the current $7,500 in federal tax credits.\n\nFisker founder and CEO Henrik Fisker has promised to offer an array of options for the retail model. The version earmarked for Pope Francis, however, will have at least one feature not available to the public: a unique, hand-built cupola in which he will be able to stand and wave to the public during his travels.\n\nThe bulletproof glass canopy, Fisker said, will be hidden within the SUV\u2019s roof until needed by the pope. It will then rise up with the touch of a button. He declined to offer other details, such as whether the electric popemobile will use the high-performance powertrain the company is developing for the Ocean SUV. That system will be capable of launching from 0 to 60 in around 3 seconds. But it will have a few other \u201cspecial details and features,\u201d Fisker said.\n\nWhat may prove more important while on the road will be the Ocean\u2019s quick-charge capability. The retail version will be able to get an 80 percent battery top-off in less than 30 minutes, according to the automaker.\n\nFisker told NBC News that for the green-minded pope himself, the battery drive system is only part of the appeal of the modified SUV. While some competitors likely will quibble with his claim that the Ocean is \u201cthe most sustainable vehicle in the world,\u201d it does forgo traditional luxury materials like leather in favor of alternatives derived from recycled soft-drink bottles and even plastics reclaimed from the ocean.\n\nOne of the highlights of the project was meeting with Francis, Fisker said, noting that \u201cthe Pope even signed the sketch I did of the Ocean in a Italian caf\u00e9 nearby, prior to the private meeting.\u201d\n\nThe Fisker founders probably could use a little intervention from up high. They will be launching their new company at a time when the electric car market is expected to see significant growth \u2014 but also a flood of new products from traditional manufacturers like Ford, General Motors and Volkswagen, as well as upstart brands like Tesla, Rivian, Lordstown Motors and others.\n\nHenrik Fisker was a pioneer in the field, bringing a plug-in hybrid to market a decade ago. But Fisker Automotive quickly went bankrupt, its assets sold to a Chinese company.\n\nThe Danish-born entrepreneur started out as a designer, earning a solid reputation for his work on less environmentally friendly products like the Aston Martin DB9 and the BMW Z8.",

According to court documents, Scerbo claimed he was the prophet Genghis Khan and accused his seatmate of being in the CIA before making inappropriate comments to her.\n\nDetails of what happened on jetBlue flight 915 initially came to light after the Captain addressed the other passengers once Scerbo had been removed from the plane by law enforcement. The Captain gave a blow by blow account of what happened, including Scerbo\u2019s alleged drug-taking, which involved multiple trips to the bathroom and a flight attendant finding a bag of white powder in his seat.\n\nAn affidavit filed in the United States District Court for the District of Minnesota now provides even more details \u2013 including an allegation that Scerbo, who was sat in JetBlue\u2019s Mint Business Class, threw his food on the floor and grabbed a metal butter knife from his tray and brandished it while walking up and down the aisle in full view of a young child.\n\nHis seatmate claims she saw Scerbo dip his finger into a bag of white powder and snort it, although he ended up with white powder all over his moustache, face and pants. During the flight, Scerbo was observed to visit the restroom at least six times.\n\nA flight attendant later found a bag containing a white substance at Scerbo\u2019s seat which later field-tested positive for cocaine and weighed 24.5 grams.

The service will be handled by the low-cost leisure travel airline Eurowings beginning in May 2022.\n\nThe group's announcement was a big step forward for the future of the airport after its new terminals opened last year. Salt Lake City had nonstop flights to London, Paris and Amsterdam, as well as flights to the Canadian cities of Calgary, Toronto and Vancouver, but all of those were halted by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nDelta plans to resume flights to Amsterdam beginning next week as nonstop international travel options slowly return.

        "27": "An early-morning meeting at a Greenwich Village townhouse, under the watchful eye of Steve McQueen, was part of a monthslong campaign.\n\nIn the predawn hours of April 1, David Zaslav, the chief executive of Discovery, arrived at a rented townhouse in Manhattan\u2019s Greenwich Village \u2014 decorated with photos of rock stars and one of the actor Steve McQueen in sunglasses holding a gun \u2014 to prepare for a meeting that would soon reverberate across the American media industry. Sworn to secrecy, Mr. Zaslav\u2019s lieutenants snacked on a breakfast of artisanal doughnuts from a 24-hour bakery as they finalized their pitch. Just before 8 a.m., ahead of schedule, their quarry arrived: John Stankey, the AT&T chief executive who controlled the WarnerMedia assets that Mr. Zaslav coveted. A journey that began with an informal, emoji-speckled email exchange in February was now fully underway. The covert discussions would eventually last three months, stretching from Dallas to the Denver suburbs to downtown Manhattan, where a war room was established in the cramped garden level of the rented townhouse. To prevent leaks, bankers used maritime nicknames like \u201cColumbus\u201d and \u201cMagellan.\u201d Even the chief executive of WarnerMedia was kept in the dark while his company was being negotiated out from under him. It would culminate on Monday with the announcement of a blockbuster media deal that combined AT&T\u2019s WarnerMedia, including HBO, CNN and the Warner Bros. film studio, with Discovery\u2019s cable and broadcast holdings, creating a powerful new force in American entertainment, sports, reality TV, news and streaming video. And it represented an astounding late career act for Mr. Zaslav, 61, that would put him in control of one of the biggest media companies in the world.\n\nThis account is based on interviews with 18 people who helped put together or had knowledge of the biggest media deal of the year, many of whom spoke on condition of anonymity in order to share the details of sensitive conversations.

Mr. Zaslav invited Mr. Stankey to visit him in New York on March 2. Mr. Zaslav lives in Conan O\u2019Brien\u2019s former apartment on Central Park West, but he bought a townhouse in Greenwich Village after his wife, Pam, grew weary of Mr. Zaslav\u2019s impromptu meetings at their home. That townhouse was under renovation \u2014 so Mr. Zaslav rented another one, where he eventually met with his potential partner from AT&T. As the conversations gathered intensity, Mr. Zaslav looped in his Discovery brain trust for the April 1 meeting with Mr. Stankey, where he needed to put his best foot forward. Around 5:30 a.m., Mr. Zaslav was joined by two associates: Gunnar Wiedenfels, Discovery\u2019s chief financial officer, and Mr. Campbell, his longtime lieutenant and a colleague of 24 years, who had helped hammer out many of Discovery\u2019s acquisitions, including its $14.6 billion purchase of Scripps in 2018 and the $1.1 billion purchase of Eurosport in 2015.\n\n\u201cThat photo,\u201d Mr. Campbell said, \u201cbecame a totem or sort of the mascot of the deal to me.\u201d Even as Mr. Zaslav negotiated with Mr. Stankey, he knew he would also have to sell the idea to two of the biggest names in American media. John Malone, the billionaire chairman of Liberty Media, and Steven Newhouse, the chairman of Advance, owner of Cond\u00e9 Nast, were the primary shareholders in Discovery and would need to sign off.\n\u2022 The U.S.D.A. will begin making debt relief payments to minority farmers in June.\n\u2022 Existing-home sales declined in April, with a tight supply and record prices. For advice, Discovery turned to Allen & Company; AT&T tapped LionTree, the boutique firm run by the Hollywood deal maestro Aryeh Bourkoff. Mr. Bourkoff\u2019s presence was noteworthy: one of his earliest clients was Mr. Malone. In a reminder of the whiplash-inducing speed at which AT&T was shedding WarnerMedia, once a prized asset, one of the bankers involved, Kurt Simon of Goldman Sachs (hired by AT&T), had helped broker its purchase of Time Warner just three years prior. Now he was back at the negotiating table figuring out how to unwind it. Code names were used to ensure secrecy. For AT&T, WarnerMedia was \u201cMagellan\u201d and Discovery was \u201cDrake.\u201d The Discovery side had its own cryptic handles, calling the deal \u201cProject Home Run,\u201d with each company named for baseball greats: \u201cWilliams\u201d for WarnerMedia, \u201cAaron\u201d for AT&T and \u201cDiMaggio\u201d for Discovery. For AT&T, the appeal was obvious: shedding a big portion of the crushing debt the company had amassed. But in order to complete the transaction, AT&T needed a bridge loan \u2014 worth more than $40 billion. Goldman Sachs could not provide the entire amount, so JPMorgan stepped in to help cover the loan. Mr. Stankey insisted on another point: He wanted the new company to have a simple ownership structure, with just one class of shares that anyone could buy. It would make the company smoother to run. And by eliminating the use of shares with disproportionate voting power, the AT&T leader would ensure that the new company could be an easier takeover target in the future, should an even bigger suitor \u2014 say, Amazon or Apple \u2014 come calling.\n\nDeals are rarely smooth, and an anomaly with Discovery\u2019s share price dovetailed with the negotiations. Discovery\u2019s stock began to inexplicably rocket in February and March to $75 from $45 because of a convoluted trading scandal involving Archegos, a little-known private investment firm that bet big on Discovery and other companies via derivatives using billions in borrowed money. With banks forced to buy shares to hedge their spiraling exposure to Archegos, Discovery\u2019s market value jumped nearly 60 percent, for no obvious reason to outsiders. But by May, the stock had returned to where it was during Mr. Zaslav\u2019s initial approach, and the two sides ultimately forged a deal that gave 71 percent of the new company to AT&T shareholders and 29 percent to Discovery. Now, the trick was closing it before word could leak out. One awkward conversation awaiting Mr. Stankey was with Jason Kilar, the former chief of Hulu tapped by AT&T, with great fanfare, just a year earlier to lead WarnerMedia. To mark the occasion of his first anniversary on the job, Mr. Kilar had agreed \u2014 with AT&T\u2019s blessing \u2014 to be profiled by The Wall Street Journal. He invited a reporter in late April to interview him on the Warner Bros. lot in Burbank, Calif., unaware that across the country, his colleagues were feverishly working to close the deal. At some point during the week of May 3, Mr. Stankey dropped the bomb: He informed Mr. Kilar that the company would soon change hands, and it was unclear what Mr. Kilar\u2019s role might be. The 2,600-word Journal profile of Mr. Kilar, which included a quote from Mr. Stankey, was published on May 14, three days before the deal was announced. Usually a cheerful presence on Twitter, Mr. Kilar didn\u2019t bother sharing the article with his 37,000 followers. By the weekend, Mr. Kilar had retained the entertainment power lawyer Allen Grubman to start negotiating his exit. A little after 7 a.m. on Sunday, Mr. Zaslav boarded a corporate jet at a small airport on the East End of Long Island, not far from his home, to head to AT&T\u2019s Dallas headquarters to put the finishing touches on the deal. But just over an hour into the flight, word got out through Bloomberg\u2019s black-and-orange terminal screens: \u201cAT&T is in talks to combine content assets with Discovery.\u201d",

        "31": "California accounted for an outsized portion of the nation\u2019s new jobs last month, although its path to economic recovery from the pandemic remains steep.\n\n\u201cIn April, California was the locomotive pulling the U.S. economy forward,\u201d said Sung Won Sohn, a professor of finance and economics at Loyola Marymount University. The Golden State created 38% of the nation\u2019s new jobs in April. But that was mainly due to the state emerging from a \u201clockdown harder and longer than in many parts of the country,\u201d Sohn said.\n\nCalifornia has a long way to go in recovering from its deep COVID-19 pandemic recession: More than half the jobs it lost have yet to return. The unemployment rate remained stagnant in April at 8.3%, the same as in March, state officials reported Friday.\n\nAlthough the state\u2019s job creation pace was comparatively robust in April, it slowed slightly from the previous month. Employers added 101,800 new positions last month for a total of more than 16.2 million. That was less than the 132,400 jobs added in March.\n\nNearly two-thirds of California\u2019s job growth in the last three months was in the leisure and hospitality businesses that were most damaged during the pandemic. Their employment level remained 28% below the pre-pandemic level.\n\nIn Los Angeles County, which relies heavily on tourism, the economy remained in dire straits. Unemployment grew to 11.7% from 11.4% in March and more than half a million people were counted as out of work.\n\n\u201cLos Angeles has been especially hard-hit by closures or severe limitations of such critical industries as hospitality, dining, travel, entertainment, and film production,\u201d said Lynn Reaser, an economist at San Diego\u2019s Point Loma Nazarene University.\n\nThe state\u2019s jobless rate was the second highest in the nation in April, after Hawaii\u2019s 8.5%. U.S. unemployment stood at 6.1% last month.\n\nYear over year, California\u2019s job growth has been slower than the nation\u2019s; the state gained 8.7%, compared with 10.9% for the U.S.\n\nStill, economists are growing more optimistic after Gov. Gavin Newsom announced the state\u2019s economy should fully reopen by June 15. \u201cCalifornia\u2019s economy is ready to boom this summer when business restrictions are lifted,\u201d Reaser said.\n\nPomona College economist Fernando Lozano suggested job creation was \u201cmoderate\u201d last month because many schools were only partially open, child care was sparse and federal business loans had dried up. \u201cMany households moved to more affordable areas, yet the jobs are reopening in the more expensive, urban communities,\u201d he said.\n\nPepperdine University economist David M. Smith predicted the Golden State economy will achieve full employment by the fall. Despite geographical mismatches, \u201cCalifornia is a jobs-producing machine,\u201d he said. \u201cUnemployment in the tech-dominated San Francisco is trending at less than half that of Los Angeles with its harder-hit small businesses, and entertainment and hospitality industries.\u201d\n\nNeel Sodha, the founder of LA Walking Tours, reduced the hours of his 13 guides during the pandemic. His company\u2019s revenue remains half of what it was before the virus hit, despite easing COVID restrictions. \u201cYou would think that with the vaccines coming out and cases going down there would be more business,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is not happening.\u201d\n\nTourists remain leery of hanging out with strangers for a two-hour tour, and the limits on international travel are hurting business, he said. Before the pandemic, tourists from abroad represented about 20% of his clients. Now he rarely sees an international traveler, and about 90% of his customers are locals.\n\nApril Clemmer, owner of Old Hollywood Walking Tours, a one-woman enterprise, said her business dried up completely when the pandemic hit. She took down her reservation calendar and began giving virtual tours, during which clients could watch her presentation of 1930s Hollywood on their computer screens.\n\nPrivate tours, which enable groups of family or friends to avoid the danger of walking close to strangers, also helped. Now with the virus abating, clients have begun to inquire about public tours. \u201cI feel like it\u2019s ticking back up again,\u201d she said.\n\nClemmer is so optimistic that she is training a second tour guide to handle what she expects will be a summer surge.\n\nStatewide, April employment grew in seven of California\u2019s broad industry sectors. The largest gain \u2014 62,800 jobs in leisure and hospitality \u2014 was mainly driven by the reopening of full-service restaurants, officials said.\n\nThe professional and business services sector, which includes lawyers, accountants and technical specialists, added 19,000 positions. Payrolls in the \u201cother services\u201d sector, which includes hairdressers, auto repair shops and other miscellaneous businesses, grew by 10,500.\n\nThe largest loss was in the information sector, which shrank by 3,500 jobs, mainly in software publishing.\n\nLos Angeles County payrolls added 34,600 jobs in April for a total of more than 4.14 million. The leisure and hospitality sector accounted for 58% of the new jobs. Positions in healthcare and social assistance grew by 6,000.\n\nOrange County payrolls added 23,800 jobs for a total of more than 1.54 million. Leisure and hospitality accounted for 56% of the gain. Unemployment slid to 6.2% from 6.3% in March.\n\nThe Inland Empire, spanning Riverside and San Bernardino counties, added 6,700 payroll jobs for a total of more than 1.51 million. Leisure and hospitality accounted for 4,500 of the new jobs. Unemployment was 7.6%, down from 7.7% in March.\n\nThe employment data for April are based on two federal surveys taken in the second week of the month. Payroll job numbers are based on a survey of 80,000 California businesses. The unemployment rate comes from a separate survey of 5,100 households.",

        "36": "As more than 3.7 million Americans could start seeing enhanced unemployment benefits end next month, the Labor Department is struggling to find a way to keep unemployed workers from being cut off as the clock ticks down. An official told CBS News the federal government paying the benefits to some unemployed Americans directly is \"pretty much off the table.\"\n\nThe department is facing pressure from Democratic lawmakers and progressive groups to act as a growing number of Republican-led states have announced they will opt out of the federal program created in the wake of the pandemic.\n\nAt least 22 GOP-led states have announced this month that they will be ending enhanced unemployment benefits early. This includes the $300 a week supplemental benefits, as well as in nearly all cases the program for gig workers and self-employed individuals who do not qualify for traditional unemployment and the program for those facing long term unemployment. The state leaders claim their states have plenty of jobs and the benefits deter people from working.\n\n\"It's cruel, it's ugly, it's insidious and it's a lie,\" said Sharon Corpening, about that argument. The 60-year-old Roswell, Georgia resident was freelancing in advertising and copywriting until the pandemic hit. As such, she did not qualify for traditional unemployment, but was able to receive Pandemic Unemployment Assistance under the CARES Act, part of coronavirus relief efforts passed under President Trump that offered benefits to workers in fields not eligible for traditional benefits.\n\nWhen some state officials and business groups claim the job market is booming as the pandemic subsides, that does not mean immediate employment opportunities for her as a longtime career professional. She has been actively job hunting and networking, but she is pushing to use her expertise. And as someone with fibromyalgia, she also has health concerns.\n\n\"Them pulling the plug on this a couple months short makes a critical difference,\" Corpening said. \"They've cast this wide net, and it's devastating. Even just a few months, it means they're forcing people out of their careers.\"\n\nMany of the states announcing an end to benefits have lower vaccination rates, according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data. For 58-year-old Cindy Lang of Parma, Ohio, who is also the caretaker of her disabled parents, health is still a very real concern. When the pandemic hit, it took more than two months for the self-employed painter to receive unemployment benefits under the CARES Act.\n\n\"I'm sorry, the 400 bucks a week is like two days of my normal pay, so why would I not want to get back to work? The math doesn't add up,\" said Lang. \"It's not that we don't want to work out here. We absolutely want to work, but I'm still protecting my parents. I'm only going to start working for clients that I trust to wear masks or have been vaccinated.\"\n\nThe Labor Department also disagrees with state GOP leaders. One official called the situation \"catastrophic.\" But even if the Labor Department had the authority to provide benefits on its own, setting up the technology to do so could take months. And the department would have to obtain the unemployment data \u2014 which would need to be provided by the states now choosing to opt out.\n\nIn a letter last week to the Labor secretary, Senator Bernie Sanders said the department was \"congressionally-mandated\" to provide Pandemic Unemployment Assistance for workers ineligible for state aid and to ensure they receive such benefits, but even fot that program, while the legislative language is different, it still relies on the the states having an agreement with the secretary.\n\nHaving unemployment benefits continue may require Congress to amend the CARES Act.\n\nSome states say they will end the program as early as June 12. States are required to send the Labor Department a letter notifying them at least 30 days out of their decision to end their agreement. The Labor Department is still working out what will be included in its response to each state \u2014 pending their determination on the administration's next steps.",

Sign up here!\n\n(Kitco News) - The cryptocurrency market has been the asset class to watch this year as bitcoin prices saw a historic move to an all-time high of $65,000 a token in April.\n\nSince the start of the year, the rally in bitcoin was so potent that many investors started seeing it as a new inflation hedge and competition for gold. From the start of the year to its highs, bitcoin rallied nearly 125%.\n\nHowever, what a lot of those investors forgot is that bitcoin is an inherently volatile market. Investors have now been reminded of the inherent risks in digital currencies. This week, we saw the price of bitcoin briefly fall below $30,000 a token, a drop of 53% from its all-time highs seen last month.\n\nThe massive price swings and increase demand caused service disruptions among many digital currency exchanges. The attention and volatility prompted Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell to take the very unusual step of releasing a video statement regarding the cryptocurrency market.\n\n\"To date, cryptocurrencies have not served as a convenient way to make payments, given, among other factors, their swings in value,\" Powell said in the statement.\n\nAs the shine comes off bitcoin, investors look for a safe harbor from the volatility and uncertainty and turn their attention back to gold. Many analysts have said that with bitcoin struggling, gold prices could push back to $2,000 an ounce by the end of the year.\n\nNot only is gold a traditional safe-haven asset, but it is also an important hedge against inflation.\n\nEvery day, as the global economy continues to recover, we see new evidence of the growing inflation threat. For many analysts, this is the major factor that will continue to support gold prices throughout the year.\n\nEven the mention from the Federal Reserve that the committee could soon be talking about tapering its bond-purchasing program didn't spook gold investors. The reality is even if the Federal Reserve starts tightening its ultra-accommodative monetary policies, they are still way behind the curve.\n\nIn a commentary on Kitco.com this week, Lobo Tiggre, creator of the IndependentSpeculator.com, noted that many Americans don't know what it is like to deal with inflation, but he warned them that they soon could.\n\nHe noted that inflation is \"No merely intellectual argument for me. I can still feel the shock of that overnight devaluation of the peso in the 1970s. This truth is a visceral reality for me. This is why I still save in gold and silver to this day,\" he said.\n\nAccording to some analysts, with inflation moving higher, real interest rates could hit new historic negative lows, which is the perfect environment for precious metals.\n\nIf you need further proof of rising inflation, you don't have to look very far. Friday, analysts at IHS Markit noted that input costs for both the manufacturing and the service sectors are at their highest level since 2008.\n\nMeanwhile, on the same day, the National Association of Realtors (NAR) noted that the median home price in April rose to $341,600, the highest level on record.\n\nWhile the Federal Reserve continues to see the growing inflation pressures as transitory, many analysts note that these pressures could be around a lot longer than expected.",

        "40": "Learning Bitcoin With Charts: How Are Hash Rate, Difficulty And Fees Related?\n\nBitcoin\u2019s difficulty adjustment mechanism is one of its most important aspects, but learning how it works can be a daunting task. This article leverages on-chain data to visualize how this mechanism works and how it relates to hash rate, block intervals, transaction fees, and the mempool. After reading this article, you will have a better understanding of why at certain times using Bitcoin may appear to be relatively slow and expensive, but also how Bitcoin fixes this and why this process is so essential to ensure Bitcoin\u2019s monetary properties.\n\nIf you have heard of Bitcoin, you have probably heard that its supply is hard capped at 21 million units (BTC), making it a perfectly scarce asset and thus the ultimate \u201chard money.\u201d\n\nWhen Bitcoin was created, miners received 50 BTC for each new block as a reward for their work. The software has a built-in rule that after every 210,000 blocks that are mined (approximately every 4 years, if the block interval is 10 minutes), this \u201cblock subsidy\u201d is cut in half during an event called \u201cthe halving.\u201d During this first \u201creward era\u201d\u2019 which ended November 28, 2012, 10.5 million BTC were mined \u2014 half of its maximum supply. During the second reward era, half of that amount (10.5 million / 2 = 5.25 million) was issued, followed by half of that (5.25 million / 2 = 2.625 million) during the third reward era \u2014 and so forth. After 32 halvings, the block subsidy equals the smallest unit in Bitcoin (0.00000001 BTC = 1 sat) and cannot be split after, which means the block subsidy falls away completely after that (believed to be in the year 2140, if block intervals were 10 minutes during its entire existence). The first 14 reward eras of Bitcoin\u2019s issuance schedule are visualized in figure one.\n\nThe careful reader will have noticed that in the previous paragraph, we mentioned twice that the actual calendar dates on which these halving events occur depend on the block intervals and that we assumed 10 minutes here. Why is it important that this supply issuance schedule is predictable in regular calendar-times in the first place?\n\nThe Importance Of Relatively Stable Block Intervals\n\nLet\u2019s consider what it would look like if Bitcoin didn\u2019t have a built-in difficulty adjustment mechanism, but simply had a fixed mining difficulty.\n\nIf that fixed difficulty had been set relatively high, early mining would have been very expensive and blocks would have come in at a very slow pace early on. Clearly, that wouldn\u2019t have been ideal to bootstrap a new network and could have meant that it never succeeded in the first place.\n\nOn the other extreme, if the difficulty would have been set relatively low to incentivize early network participants to join, block intervals would have gotten smaller as more miners joined the network, and blocks would have come in at an increasingly quicker pace. It would have quickly run through its entire supply issuance schedule. Had this happened, the Bitcoin network likely wouldn\u2019t have had enough time to develop the block space market needed to sufficiently incentivize miners to keep mining blocks in order to process transactions and secure the network after the block subsidy had run out.\n\nTo summarize, relatively stable block intervals are needed to spread out Bitcoin\u2019s supply issuance over time, which in turn is needed to incentivize miners to keep joining the network over a relatively long bootstrapping period, as well as to gradually develop a block space market that will be able to keep the lights on after the block subsidy reward runs out.\n\nTo guarantee that block intervals will remain relatively stable over a multi decade period, Bitcoin has a difficulty adjustment mechanism. As can be seen in figure 2, even with this built-in difficulty mechanism, its block intervals were not very stable, averaging much longer than 10 minutes per block during its first year of existence. The block intervals became more stable after Bitcoin set its first market price in July, 2010, and have been relatively stable at just under 10 minutes for over five years now (no structural up or down trends in the orange line in figure 2) \u2013 works like a charm.\n\nTo mine bitcoin, miners use highly specialized computers to basically guess a certain number (slightly simplified explanation). When a miner finds the number that the network is currently looking for, that miner earns the right to create a new block on the Bitcoin blockchain, take its block subsidy, choose which transactions to include in that block, and collect the fees of those transactions. At the time of writing, all miners that are active on the Bitcoin network are estimated to have a total capacity (hash rate) of 170 exahashes per second (EH/s), which is 170,000,000,000,000,000,000 hashes per second.\n\nIn Bitcoin\u2019s first year of existence (2009), it was still possible to mine Bitcoin on the Central Processing Unit (CPU; which is basically the central chip in a computer that takes care of lots of things) of an average consumer computer, as the network\u2019s hash rate was just a few million hashes per second. Over time, more computers joined the network and eventually chips that were better at heavy number crunching via their Graphics Processing Unit (GPU), the chip in a computer that is applied for graphical tasks and linear algebra) or even hardware custom made for Bitcoin mining (an ASIC, or Application Specific Integrated Circuit) was used.\n\nAs you can imagine, as the network\u2019s hash rate increased by a multi-trillion-fold from that first year until now, it was necessary to make it a lot harder to guess that certain number to ensure relatively stable block intervals of approximately 10 minutes each\n\nIn Bitcoin, \u201cdifficulty\u201d is the measure for how hard it is to find that number that the network is looking for. Every 2,016 blocks (14 days if block intervals are 10 minutes), the Bitcoin software basically calculates the block intervals during that period and adjusts the difficulty so that at current capacity, the average block interval will be roughly 10 minutes again.\n\nThe interplay between Bitcoin\u2019s difficulty (the 14-day moving average of the) hash rate and block intervals over the last three months is visualized in figure 3. During the first visualized difficulty adjustment period (the red column on the left), the hash rate was declining (downtrend in black line). As network capacity decreased, block intervals increased (uptrend in blue line), making it necessary to decrease the difficulty (small drop in orange line after this period).\n\nIn three difficulty adjustment periods after (first green column in figure 3), the hashrate was increasing again, blocks came in faster than planned and difficulty adjusted upwards three times. Mid-April, 2021 (right red column), there was a large power outage in China that caused a massive drop in Bitcoin\u2019s hash rate, slowing down blocks a lot and making a huge downwards difficulty adjustment necessary after the period. After this happened (right green column), the power outage itself was solved and the downwards difficulty adjustment made it much easier for miners to create blocks again. As a result, some miners with less efficient hardware and/or more expensive energy could earn a profit mining again, actually overcompensating the previous loss of hash rate, actually sending it to new all-time highs.\n\nThis latest hash rate drop and recovery is a good example of why miners leaving the network does not have a cascading effect of more miners leaving the network (sometimes called the \u201cmining death spiral\u201d by critics), but the software simply increases the remaining miners\u2019 profit margins, incentivizing other miners to (re)join the network.\n\nA side effect of this mechanism that we all feel is its impact on transaction fees. During times when the hash rate increases and blocks are coming in faster than planned (green columns in figure 4), transactions can relatively easily be included in blocks. Since this means that there are less transactions queued up in line (in Bitcoin called the \u201cmempool\u201d) to be included in upcoming blocks, transaction fees can be relatively low.\n\nThe opposite is true during periods where hash rate drops and block intervals increase (red column in figure 4). When blocks are coming in slowly, the queue of transactions waiting to get included gets crowded, and people need to bid up their transaction fees to basically jump the line. As such, transaction fees spike especially when the network capacity decreases (hash rate drops) and is waiting to be bailed out by the next difficulty adjustment.\n\nIn this section, we discussed the fees of transactions that were included in blocks. For those looking to transact on the Bitcoin network, it is even more relevant to get a feel for how much all of the transactions that are still waiting in line to be included in future blocks are bidding for their needed block space.\n\nAs briefly mentioned above, the Bitcoin mempool can be interpreted as the total of all transactions which were broadcast on the network but are still waiting in line to be included in a future block. Technically, each of the thousands of Bitcoin nodes on the network has its own mempool, but since they are mostly well interconnected, visualizing them as a single waiting line is alright for general explanatory purposes.\n\nMempool.space is an industry-standard website that gives anyone not running their own node or simply looking to get a quick look at the mempool all the relevant data. Examples are the total size of the waiting line (mempool size), how many transactions are joining the queue (incoming transactions), if blocks are coming in faster or slower than expected (estimated difficulty adjustment) and estimations of how high the transaction fee of a new transaction needs to be to be included at low, medium, or high priority.\n\nFigure 5 visualizes the mempool of the last three months. As you would expect, the patterns described in figure 4 can also be seen here. Between late February and early April 2021, when the amount of hash rate on the Bitcoin network increased and more blocks than planned were created, the mempool size (the size of the waiting line) decreased and transaction fees decreased correspondingly. After the mid-April hash rate drop, the mempool quickly increased and transaction fees skyrocketed, but both declined quite quickly after the April 30th difficulty adjustment, and subsequent hash rate growth to all-time highs.\n\nAs briefly mentioned at an earlier point in this article, Bitcoin\u2019s block subsidy is designed to decay over time, and the development of a healthy block space market where transaction fees become the primary source of revenue for miners is essential to incentivize miners to keep processing transactions and securing the network in the long-run.\n\nThis is possibly the most important test that awaits Bitcoin in the future, and is the subject of my previous Bitcoin Magazine article titled \u201cAn Ode And Forthcoming Obituary To Bitcoin\u2019s Four-year Cycle,\u201d which is a recommended follow-up read.

        "41": "Cryptocurrency is all the rage among some investors, whose portfolios gyrate wildly on a daily basis. The value of this investment type, which is a form of digital payment, frequently rises and falls violently on social media posts, internet chatter and sometimes, for seemingly no reason at all.\n\nSexy stories about investors who hit it big in crypto are making more traditional investors wonder if they should also get in the game.\n\nNJ Advance Media asked three financial advisers what they thought about crypto and whether it has a place in an investor\u2019s portfolio.\n\nAdvisers say before you invest in cryptocurrency or any other investment, you should understand how it gets its value.\n\n\u201cIt trades more like gold, which gets its value from what people think the value is versus the profits and growth potential of a company,\u201d said Jeanne Kane, a certified financial planner with JFL Total Wealth Management in Boonton, who noted there are more than 5,300 different kinds of crypto today.\n\nThere is no underlying asset with cryptocurrency, she said.\n\n\u201cIf you buy Apple stock, you know that the company makes computers, tablets and phones. The stock\u2019s value comes from their sales, what they\u2019re producing. That\u2019s not the case with cryptocurrency because there is no underlying asset,\u201d she said.\n\nKane said unlike traditional investments, cryptocurrency transactions and records are maintained by a decentralized network rather than a centralized authority, such as a bank or government entity.\n\nCryptocurrency is not FDIC-insured like your funds are at a bank, and there is no regulator like the Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC), which offers some protections for stocks and bonds held at brokerage firms, she said.\n\nSo the value of your cryptocurrency investment is based on what other investors are willing to pay for it.\n\nAt a minimum, those who choose to invest in crypto should have a basic understanding of what it is and what drives its value, said Claudia Mott, a certified financial planner with Epona Financial Solutions in Basking Ridge.\n\n\u201cThis is not an investment for the faint of heart given its extremely speculative nature,\u201d Mott said. \u201cTrading volatile assets like this can be a full-time job and those who think this is a quick way to make a buck need to consider the time and attention that needs to be paid to an investment that can gyrate 20 to 30% because of a social media post.\u201d\n\nOr any other kind of public comment.\n\nFor example, Elon Musk appeared on Saturday Night Live on May 8 and made a joke about Dogecoin. The cryptocurrency fell 40% in mere hours.\n\nIt happened again on May 12 when Musk tweeted that he would not accept Bitcoin for Tesla.\n\n\u201cHis comment caused a selloff and drop in share values that wiped $300 billion from all cryptocurrencies in a single day,\u201d Kane said. \u201cDo you want a Tweet or SNL skit to boom or bust your investments?\u201d\n\nMichael Maye, a certified financial planner and certified public accountant with MJM Financial in Gillette, said only those with a high risk tolerance should consider buying crypto.\n\n\u201cThis is currently a very high risk/high reward investment,\u201d he said. \u201cIndividuals who invest in crypto need to be prepared for wild swings in the price on any given day.\u201d\n\nBut won\u2019t I miss out if I don\u2019t buy in?\n\nThe fear of missing out \u2014 FOMO \u2014 can make the most rational of investors become irrational, Kane said.\n\n\u201cThe media hypes up stories about the investors who paid off their student loans or received astronomical returns from their cryptocurrency investments,\u201d Kane said. \u201cAre we hearing as many stories about those individual investors who lost it all with a cryptocurrency market drop? Just because someone made money on Bitcoin or with another cryptocurrency doesn\u2019t mean that you will too.\u201d\n\nMott likened the \u201ccrypto craze\u201d to the bubble of internet stocks that burst in 2000.\n\n\u201cToo many inexperienced investors think they are going to make a killing trading something they have no knowledge about,\u201d Mott said. \u201cMore than likely it will end badly for them, and for some, it already has.\u201d\n\nI still want to buy. How can I do it smartly?\n\nAdvisers said if you do want to invest in cryptocurrency, have a balanced approach that looks at the big picture for your overall finances.\n\nMott said the price gyrations alone would argue against making cryptocurrency a significant holding in any portfolio. Also, people should not use leverage or debt \u201cto fund an investment that could lose a great deal of it\u2019s value and leave the investor worse off than they started,\u201d she said.\n\nShe recommends keeping crypto out of your overall asset allocation, and use side money instead.\n\nKane said conservative investors should steer clear of a speculative investment like cryptocurrency.\n\n\u201cIf you are an aggressive investor and you feel that cryptocurrency reflects your risk tolerance and fits in the speculative part of your portfolio, invest with caution,\u201d she said. \u201cGiven its volatility, cryptocurrency should only be a very small fraction of someone\u2019s portfolio.\u201d\n\nMaye said that rather than purchase individual cryptocurrencies, investors could consider Bitwise, which in 2017 introduced the first cryptocurrency index fund and now has several other offerings.\n\nBut they, too, are volatile.\n\nFor example, the Bitwise 10 Crypto Index Fund, which tracks the 10 most highly valued cryptocurrencies, lost 19% in the past month and is down 16.9% over the past three months, but is up 70.1% so far this year and has a 321% gain since its 2017 launch.\n\nMaye said he would limit crypto exposure to 5% of your portfolio, or less, given the volatility.\n\nWhat are the tax implications?\n\nIn 2014, the IRS classified virtual currencies as property and not as currency, Maye said, noting that most crypto is considered an investment asset and is subject to capital gains rules.\n\n\u201cA crypto sold at a gain but held for less than a year is considered short term and is taxed at a taxpayer\u2019s ordinary income tax rate,\u201d Maye said. \u201cA crypto that is sold at a gain but held over one year is considered long term and taxed at long-term capital gains rates, which currently range from 0% to 20% based on the taxpayer\u2019s income level.\u201d\n\nSome higher earning taxpayers might also owe an additional 3.8% surtax.\n\nIf a cryptocurrency investment is sold at a loss, it can be used to offset capital gains taxes plus up to $3,000 in ordinary income, Maye said. For federal tax purposes, unused capital losses can be carried forward to future tax years but many states, including New Jersey, don\u2019t have a carry forward rule, he said.\n\nAnd on Thursday, the Treasury Department released a report detailing IRS changes as part of the American Families Plan. If passed, the bill would require reporting of crypto transfers if they exceed $10,000.\n\nHave you bought any crypto personally?\n\nNone of the advisers we spoke to have personally purchased any cryptocurrency.\n\n\u201cI am not a speculative investor and don\u2019t wish to blow my money on something that I may not be able to trade if the platform shuts down,\u201d Mott said.\n\nMaye also said he hasn\u2019t, and he has no plans to.\n\n\u201cI do believe crypto will be around longer term as it is an interesting technology, but no one knows what regulatory environment awaits nor which crypto will dominate longer term,\u201d Maye said.\n\nKane said crypto doesn\u2019t fit into her investment strategy.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not much of a gambler and tend to invest in mutual funds and exchange-traded funds that historically have returned on average 8 to 10%,\u201d she said. \u201cIt may seem boring to some, but over time, it grows.

        "45": "HORSHAM, Pa., May 21, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- The Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson announced today the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted the accelerated approval of RYBREVANTTM (amivantamab-vmjw) for the treatment of adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) exon 20 insertion mutations, as detected by an FDA-approved test, whose disease has progressed on or after platinum-based chemotherapy.1 RYBREVANTTM is the first fully-human, bispecific antibody approved for the treatment of patients with NSCLC that targets EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations, which are the third most prevalent activating EGFR mutation.1,2 Today's approval follows the FDA's decision to grant Breakthrough Therapy Designation (BTD) in March 2020 and to initiate a Priority Review of the Biologics License Application (BLA) in December 2020. This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on overall response rate and duration of response.1 Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in the confirmatory trials.1\n\n\"Today's FDA approval is an important development for people living with non-small cell lung cancer with exon 20 insertion mutations who, until now, have had no approved treatment options to target their disease,\" said Jill Feldman, co-founder of the EGFR Resisters, an advocacy organization patient group, and a lung cancer patient advocate. \"We are excited by the promise this new treatment option brings to people with this particular type of lung cancer and their families.\"\n\nLung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death among both men and women, accounting for almost 25 percent of all cancer deaths.3 Currently available targeted treatments, like EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) are generally insensitive in treating NSCLC driven by EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations and are not FDA-approved for these patients.4,5,6 In addition, NSCLC driven by this mutation carries a worse prognosis and shorter survival rates compared with lung cancer driven by more common EGFR mutations, such as exon 19 deletions and L858R substitutions.7,8 Patients newly diagnosed with metastatic NSCLC with EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations have a real-world median overall survival (OS) of 16.2 months (95 percent confidence interval [CI], 11.0 \u2013 19.4), which is lower than patients with EGFR exon 19 deletions/L858R mutations, who have a real-world median OS of 25.5 months (95 percent CI, 24.5 \u2013 27.0).9\n\n\"Lung cancer is a complex disease, and through the study and deeper understanding of genetic alterations like EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations, we are able to target the disease in new ways and improve treatment outcomes for patients,\" said Joshua K. Sabari, M.D., New York University Langone's Perlmutter Cancer Center and study investigator, who presented the latest clinical trial results at the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer's (IASLC WCLC) 2020 World Conference on Lung Cancer Singapore. \"Amivantamab-vmjw is an innovative bispecific antibody that brings an important new therapeutic approach to physicians caring for patients with this serious and rare type of lung cancer.\"\n\nRYBREVANTTM is a fully-human bispecific antibody directed against EGFR and MET receptors.1 RYBREVANTTM binds extracellularly (outside of the cell) inhibiting tumor growth and leading to tumor cell death.1 Today's accelerated FDA approval is based on positive results from the Phase 1 CHRYSALIS study, a multicenter, open-label, clinical study evaluating RYBREVANTTM as a monotherapy in patients enrolled in the prior platinum containing chemotherapy cohort.1,10 Initial results from the CHRYSALIS EGFR exon 20 insertion mutation population, which supported the BTD, were presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology 2020 Virtual Scientific Program, and updated results were presented at the IASLC WCLC 2020.\n\n\"The approval of RYBREVANT, along with the companion diagnostic test, addresses high unmet need in the treatment of people with genetically defined non-small cell lung cancer,\" said Peter Lebowitz, M.D., Ph.D., Global Therapeutic Area Head, Oncology, Janssen Research & Development, LLC. \"At Janssen, we are committed to the development of innovative therapies like RYBREVANT and believe that advancing medicines targeting specific pathways can bring the greatest benefits and improve outcomes for patients with tumor alterations such as EGFR and MET.\"\n\nThe FDA simultaneously approved Guardant Health's Guardant360\u00ae CDx liquid biopsy blood test as a companion diagnostic for use with RYBREVANTTM.\n\nNext-generation sequencing test offers an alternative to polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based tests which fail to identify 50 percent or more of exon 20 insertion mutations.11 Information on FDA-approved tests for the detection of EGFR genetic alterations in NSCLC is available at: http://www.fda.gov/CompanionDiagnostics.\n\n\"Today's milestone reflects progress and determination in our mission to develop and deliver transformational therapies to improve the lives of people diagnosed with some of the most devastating and complex diseases of our time,\" said Mathai Mammen, M.D., Ph.D., Global Head, Janssen Research & Development, Johnson & Johnson. \"The approval of RYBREVANT, the first lung cancer treatment for Johnson & Johnson, strengthens our commitment to harness science, expertise and scale to dramatically alter the trajectory of lung cancer, and reduce the impact of the world's leading cause of cancer mortality.\"\n\nAbout RYBREVANTTM\n\nRYBREVANTTM is being studied in a comprehensive clinical development program for people with untreated advanced EGFR-mutated NSCLC, including the Phase 3 MARIPOSA (NCT04487080) trial studying RYBREVANTTM in combination with lazertinib**.12 Another Phase 3 trial, PAPILLON (NCT04538664), is studying RYBREVANTTM in combination with carboplatin-pemetrexed for people with advanced or metastatic EGFR-mutated NSCLC with exon 20 insertion mutations.13 RYBREVANTTM received U.S. FDA BTD in March 2020 and Priority Review Designation following the BLA announcement in December 2020.14,15 Janssen has filed regulatory submissions for RYBREVANTTM with health authorities in Europe and other markets.\n\n**In 2018, Janssen Biotech, Inc. entered into a license and collaboration agreement with Yuhan Corporation for the development of lazertinib.\n\nAbout the CHRYSALIS Study \n\nCHRYSALIS (NCT02609776) is a Phase 1 open-label, multicenter, first-in-human study to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics and preliminary efficacy of RYBREVANTTM as a monotherapy and in combinations including with lazertinib, a novel third-generation EGFR TKI16, in adults with advanced NSCLC.10 The study consists of two parts: RYBREVANTTM monotherapy and combination-dose escalations and RYBREVANTTM monotherapy and combination-dose expansions.10\n\nIn the ongoing Phase 1 CHRYSALIS study, patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC with EGFR Exon 20 insertion mutations weighing less than 80 kg received RYBREVANTTM 1050 mg and patients weighing at least 80 kg or more received RYBREVANTTM 1400 mg weekly for four weeks, with the initial dose as a split infusion in week 1 on day 1 and day 2, then administered every two weeks thereafter until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.1 Disease response using overall response rate (ORR), per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1* (RECIST v1.1) as evaluated by Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR), was the primary endpoint.1 In the prior-platinum chemotherapy treated cohort (n=81), the confirmed ORR, as assessed by blinded independent central review, was 40 percent (95 percent CI, 29 \u2013 51), with 3.7 percent having complete responses (CR) and 36 percent achieving partial responses (PR).1\n\nPermanent discontinuation of RYBREVANTTM due to an adverse reaction (AE) occurred in 11 percent of patients who received RYBREVANTTM.1 AEs resulting in permanent discontinuation of RYBREVANTTM in greater than or equal to one percent of patients were pneumonia, infusion-related reactions (IRR), pneumonitis/interstitial lung disease (ILD) dyspnea, pleural effusion and rash.1 Dose interruptions of RYBREVANTTM due to AEs occurred in 78 percent of patients.1 IRR requiring infusions interruptions occurred in 59 percent of patients.1 Adverse reactions requiring dose interruption in greater than or equal to five percent of patients included dyspnea, nausea, rash, vomiting, fatigue and diarrhea.1 The most common AEs (greater than or equal to 20 percent) in patients who received RYBREVANTTM were rash (84 percent), IRR (64 percent), paronychia (50 percent), musculoskeletal pain (47 percent), dyspnea (37 percent), nausea (36 percent), fatigue (33 percent), edema (27 percent), stomatitis (26 percent), cough (25 percent), constipation (23 percent) and vomiting (22 percent).1\n\n*RECIST (version 1.1) refers to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, which is a standard way to measure how well solid tumors respond to treatment and is based on whether tumors shrink, stay the same or get bigger.17\n\nAccess to RYBREVANTTM (amivantamab-vmjw)\n\nJanssen offers comprehensive access and support information and resources to assist patients in gaining access to RYBREVANTTM. Janssen will work closely with payers and providers to ensure RYBREVANTTM is broadly accessible and affordable for people with NSCLC with EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations.

Among patients receiving treatment on Week 1 Day 1, 65% experienced an IRR, while the incidence of IRR was 3.4% with the Day 2 infusion, 0.4% with the Week 2 infusion, and cumulatively 1.1% with subsequent infusions. Of the reported IRRs, 97% were Grade 1-2, 2.2% were Grade 3, and 0.4% were Grade 4. The median time to onset was 1 hour (range 0.1 to 18 hours) after start of infusion. The incidence of infusion modifications due to IRR was 62% and 1.3% of patients permanently discontinued RYBREVANT\u2122 due to IRR.\n\nPremedicate with antihistamines, antipyretics, and glucocorticoids and infuse RYBREVANT\u2122 as recommended. Administer RYBREVANT\u2122 via a peripheral line on Week 1 and Week 2. Monitor patients for any signs and symptoms of infusion reactions during RYBREVANT\u2122 infusion in a setting where cardiopulmonary resuscitation medication and equipment are available. Interrupt infusion if IRR is suspected. Reduce the infusion rate or permanently discontinue RYBREVANT\u2122 based on severity.\n\nInterstitial Lung Disease/Pneumonitis1\n\nRYBREVANT\u2122 can cause interstitial lung disease (ILD)/pneumonitis. Based on the safety population, ILD/pneumonitis occurred in 3.3% of patients treated with RYBREVANT\u2122, with 0.7% of patients experiencing Grade 3 ILD/pneumonitis. Three patients (1%) discontinued RYBREVANT\u2122 due to ILD/pneumonitis.\n\nMonitor patients for new or worsening symptoms indicative of ILD/pneumonitis (e.g., dyspnea, cough, fever). Immediately withhold RYBREVANT\u2122 in patients with suspected ILD/pneumonitis and permanently discontinue if ILD/pneumonitis is confirmed.\n\nDermatologic Adverse Reactions1\n\nRYBREVANT\u2122 can cause rash (including dermatitis acneiform), pruritus and dry skin. Based on the safety population, rash occurred in 74% of patients treated with RYBREVANT\u2122, including Grade 3 rash in 3.3% of patients. The median time to onset of rash was 14 days (range: 1 to 276 days). Rash leading to dose reduction occurred in 5% of patients, and RYBREVANT\u2122 was permanently discontinued due to rash in 0.7% of patients.\n\nToxic epidermal necrolysis occurred in one patient (0.3%) treated with RYBREVANT\u2122.\n\nInstruct patients to limit sun exposure during and for 2 months after treatment with RYBREVANT\u2122. Advise patients to wear protective clothing and use broad spectrum UVA/UVB sunscreen. Alcohol free emollient cream is recommended for dry skin.\n\nIf skin reactions develop, start topical corticosteroids and topical and/or oral antibiotics. For Grade 3 reactions, add oral steroids and consider dermatologic consultation. Promptly refer patients presenting with severe rash, atypical appearance or distribution, or lack of improvement within 2 weeks to a dermatologist. Withhold, dose reduce or permanently discontinue RYBREVANT\u2122 based on severity.\n\nOcular Toxicity1\n\nRYBREVANT\u2122 can cause ocular toxicity including keratitis, dry eye symptoms, conjunctival redness, blurred vision, visual impairment, ocular itching, and uveitis. Based on the safety population, keratitis occurred in 0.7% and uveitis occurred in 0.3% of patients treated with RYBREVANT\u2122. All events were Grade 1-2. Promptly refer patients presenting with eye symptoms to an ophthalmologist. Withhold, dose reduce or permanently discontinue RYBREVANT\u2122 based on severity.\n\nEmbryo Fetal Toxicity1\n\nBased on its mechanism of action and findings from animal models, RYBREVANT\u2122 can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to the fetus. Advise female patients of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for 3 months after the final dose of RYBREVANT\u2122.\n\nAdverse Reactions1 \n\nThe most common adverse reactions (\u226520%) were rash, IRR, paronychia, musculoskeletal pain, dyspnea, nausea, fatigue, edema, stomatitis, cough, constipation, and vomiting. The most common Grade 3 or 4 laboratory abnormalities (\u22652%) were decreased lymphocytes, decreased albumin, decreased phosphate, decreased potassium, increased alkaline phosphatase, increased glucose, increased gamma-glutamyl transferase, and decreased sodium.\n\nAbout the Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson\n\nAt Janssen, we're creating a future where disease is a thing of the past.

The company is seeking $10 billion in damages and wants the case tried in front of a jury.\n\nThe complaint alleges that while most of McDonald's advertising budget is allocated for the \"general market,\" it maintains a \"separate 'African American' tier, run by a different advertising company, \"with a much smaller budget and less-favorable pricing and other terms.\"\n\nHow much smaller? \"McDonald's President and CEO Chris Kempczinski makes approximately $11 million per year, which is more than double what McDonald's spends per year on all of Black-owned media combined,\" Allen's networks say.\n\nUSA TODAY has reached out to both McDonald's and Allen's companies for comment.\n\nIn its complaint, Entertainment Studios says it was never asked to respond for requests for proposals from the white-owned ad agency that allocates the general market budget, shutting them out of the opportunity to win its business. \"Instead, Entertainment Studios was forced to compete with African American media companies in the less-favorable African American tier.\"\n\nIn addition, it alleges McDonald's has refused to advertise on the 12 networks of Entertainment Studios or even the Weather Channel which Allen bought in 2018 and does not target any ethnic group.\n\nThe complaint notes that Allen personally took the issue of McDonald's discriminatory ad practices up with its chief marketing officer \u2013 to no avail.\n\n\"This is about economic inclusion of African American-owned businesses in the U.S. economy,\" said Allen in a statement that accompanied the lawsuit. \"McDonald's takes billions from African American consumers and gives almost nothing back. The biggest trade deficit in America is the trade deficit between White corporate America and Black America, and McDonald's is guilty of perpetuating this disparity. The economic exclusion must stop immediately.\"\n\nOn Thursday, the same day the lawsuit was filed, McDonald's announced it was allocating more ad dollars to diverse-owned media and embarking on multi-year partnerships with them.\n\n\"McDonald\u2019s total investment in diverse-owned partners \u2013 including Black, Hispanic, Asian Pacific American, Women and LGBTQ-owned platforms \u2013 will more than double, moving from 4% to 10% of national advertising spend between 2021 and 2024,\" it said in a press release. \"Spend with Black-owned properties, specifically, will increase from 2% to 5% of national advertising spend over this time period.\"",

Indian officials said this week that 98% of its population of about 1.3 billion remains susceptible to infection.\n\nIndia's foreign minister plans to visit the United States in the coming weeks in part to ease Pfizer's concerns, one of the sources said. He could offer Pfizer some form of protection from lawsuits in exchange for the company providing additional assistance with distributing its shots in India, two other sources said.\n\nThe Indian foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nOne of the sources added that the two parties discussed the indemnity issue as recently as late this week but have not yet reached a resolution.\n\nA Pfizer spokeswoman said that the company is still in talks with India on a deal and they have not reached an impasse, adding that Pfizer remains hopeful about reaching an agreement.\n\nPfizer has been consistent in its position on indemnity and is not planning to change its approach for a deal with India, one of the sources said. All of the sources declined to be identified because they are not authorized to speak to the media.\n\nIndia's health ministry did not reply to Reuters requests for comment on Friday.\n\nIndia pledged last month to fast-track approvals for overseas vaccine makers including Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson and Johnson.\n\nHowever, none have since sought permission from India's drug regulator to sell their vaccine there.\n\nOne source said that another issue being discussed between Pfizer and New Delhi was the Indian government's insistence on a local trial for any vaccine approval. The source added that Pfizer cannot finalize terms of a supply agreement, including indemnity, if the vaccine is not first authorized for use in India.\n\nPfizer withdrew its application for emergency use authorisation for the vaccine developed with Germany's BioNTech in February after India insisted on such a trial.\n\nBut three other shots on sale in India, developed by AstraZeneca, Russia's Sputnik V and Bharat Biotech in collaboration with state-run Indian Council of Medical Research, have completed the small-scale safety trials.\n\nPfizer's chief executive Albert Bourla said on May 4 that he was hopeful that the government would change its policy of local trials and that a path to delivering the drugmaker's shots in India could be found.

Remember, the savings you carry into your senior years will need to last for several decades, and starting out with a couple of million or more is a good way to help ensure you don't run out of money in your lifetime.\n\nFurthermore, you may have the goal of becoming a millionaire before reaching your senior years. That's a reasonable objective, too.\n\nThe key, either way, is to start investing at an early age and choose your investments wisely. And guess what? You don't have to be an investing guru to check the latter box off. All you really need to do is put this one ETF in your portfolio.\n\nETFs, or exchange-traded funds, make investing really simple. The reason? You can buy shares of a single ETF and add dozens of stocks or more to your portfolio. And if your goal is to wind up a millionaire, the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF(NYSEMKT: VOO) is a good bet.\n\nThe S&P 500 indexconsists of \u2013 you guessed it \u2013 500 stocks, only they're not just any stocks. Those 500 companies are the largest ones that trade publicly, so they're a solid measure of how the stock market, on a whole, is performing.

Say you invest $500 in this one ETF every month and its performance is comparable \u2013 let's call it 15%. Keep that up for 30 years, and you'll be sitting on a cool $2.6 million.\n\nEven if the S&P 500 \u2013 and the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF \u2013 only delivers an average annual 10% return during that time, you'll still be looking at just about $1 million in your portfolio from that investment alone.\n\nPlus, the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF has a very low expense ratio \u2013 just 0.03%. That's the beauty of ETFs \u2013 you won't pay high investment fees that eat away at your returns because these funds are passively managed.\n\nAn easy way to accrue millions\n\nThe Vanguard S&P 500 ETF is only one of many ETFs that track the S&P 500. And to be clear, there are other indexes you could look at if your goal is to grow long-term wealth. But the S&P 500 has a strong history of delivering solid returns, and it's a good bet if your goal is to become a millionaire without doing a lot of work to get there.\n\nThe one drawback of buying shares of the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF is that it won't help your portfolio outperform the broad market.

Liggins has previously said they\u2019re in talks with some local restaurateurs to open concepts at the development.\n\nUrban One claims the project would generate $525 million in tax revenue over the next decade, and that they would pay the city a $140 million up-front payment. Per its website, Urban One estimates that 77 percent of the casino\u2019s visitors would be non-locals.\n\nStoney, who said the project would be \u201can additional economic engine in South Richmond,\u201d is now preparing to introduce the casino matter to the Richmond City Council at its May 24 meeting.\n\nIf approved, it would head to the Virginia Lottery Board, which regulates casinos in the state, before the city petitions Richmond Circuit Court for the referendum to be placed on the ballot in November.\n\nZed Smith, The Cordish Cos.\u2019 COO, issued a statement expressing their disappointment in losing out on the deal.\n\n\u201cWhile we believe our site clearly would have brought the largest long-term economic benefit to the City and its residents, as evidenced by the City\u2019s own independent, outside consultant, we respect the Evaluation Committee\u2019s decision,\u201d Smith said.\n\nPhilip Morris owns the land on which Urban One is planning the project.

They set a June 3 hearing to consider revised rules.\n\n\u201cI think we need to continue to have some COVID requirements in place \u2014 the crisis isn\u2019t over. But I think we need to recognize that it\u2019s been mitigated to some extent,\u201d board member Chris Laszcz-Davis said.\n\nCal/OSHA regulations apply in almost every workplace in California, including those in state and local governments. Its emergency temporary standards related to the pandemic apply to all employees except those working from home or where there is a single employee who does not have contact with other people.\n\nCalifornia has made a remarkably fast transition from being an epicenter for the virus at the start of the year to a record low infection rate of less than 1% and an economy with all sectors now reopened, albeit with restrictions. More than half the state\u2019s population of nearly 40 million has received at least one vaccine dose.\n\nEmployers told the board that the improvement makes the rules less necessary, while worker advocates said having half the population unvaccinated means precautions are still needed.\n\nProposed additional employer mandates intended to make up for some relaxed regulations would \u201ccreate new unnecessary burdens and requirements,\u201d said Helen Cleary, director of the Phylmar Regulatory Roundtable, a coalition of large businesses.\n\nBusiness groups are particularly upset with a proposal requiring that employers provide masks for voluntary use starting July 31.\n\nThat potentially means regularly providing N95 face masks to 2 million workers, CalChamber\u2019s Moutrie said, assuming 20% of the state\u2019s 20 million workers can\u2019t or won\u2019t be vaccinated and half of those work indoors. The rules also would require employers to provide free coronavirus testing during work hours to unvaccinated employees with COVID-19 symptoms.\n\nStandards board chairman David Thomas later said he was inclined to permit less effective face coverings like his own blue surgical-style mask. But others said that easing some safeguards makes it more important that workers have the type of mask that provides the most protection.\n\nThomas, like other board members, said regulators must be cautious in lifting safety regulations for fear of triggering a new surge.\n\n\u201cHopefully we\u2019re getting to a place where we can open things up,\u201d Thomas said, but \u201cwe\u2019ve seen this before and we just don\u2019t want to get, for lack of a better word, we don\u2019t want to get stupid.\u201d\n\nRequiring employers to provide masks and make other provisions like installing partitions and air filters \u201cadds more burdensome obligations to employers just as the federal government is loosening restrictions and California\u2019s Governor appears to believe California is on track to open in June,\u201d more than 40 groups said in a comment letter. They include organizations representing California cities and counties, retailers and restaurateurs.\n\nMore than 40 agricultural organizations separately objected that \u201cthe state cannot reopen if businesses are still required to comply with strict and unnecessary COVID-19 restrictions.\u201d\n\nBut labor and other advocates urged caution in lifting workplace pandemic safety rules.\n\n\u201cEvery day we hear from workers about their fear of going to work, getting the virus and bringing it home to their families,\u201d said Eddie Sanchez of the Southern California Coalition for Occupational Safety and Health, which advocates particularly for workers who are immigrants or people of color. \u201dWe know from experience now that employers will not do what\u2019s right or what\u2019s safe on their own.\u201d\n\nMaggie Robbins, occupational health specialist with Worksafe Inc., an Oakland-based worker advocacy group, said Cal/OSHA shouldn\u2019t ease workplace rules just because the state is relaxing requirements in social settings, a development she said could \u201clead to basically open season in the workplace for all controls to be relaxed.\u201d\n\nThe board\u2019s staff is now reconsidering rules that would require workers to wait until July 31 before they can stop wearing masks indoors and distancing, unless everyone in the same room is fully vaccinated and not showing coronavirus symptoms.\n\n\u201cExemptions for fully vaccinated employees will not work if 100% of the workforce must be vaccinated to benefit,\u201d Cleary said.\n\nBut Cal/OSHA\u2019s staff warned that some regulations are needed even as conditions improved. \u201cEven if the state is able to reopen fully in June, COVID-19 is likely to remain a significant workplace hazard for months to come, if not longer,\u201d they advised the board.",
        "68": "Oregon was left scrambling last Thursday after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention unexpectedly announced that fully vaccinated people no longer needed to wear masks or physically distance in most circumstances.\n\nThe Oregon Health Authority responded to the announcement by trying to walk a fine line, issuing new guidance Tuesday that allows people to go maskless outside and gives businesses the option to either continue requiring masks or allow fully vaccinated customers who show proof of inoculation to forgo masks indoors. The approach appears to be unique among states reacting to the federal guidelines.\n\nBut by neither fully lifting nor retaining mask mandates, and instead requiring businesses and other institutions to check vaccination cards, Oregon has managed to please essentially no one.\n\nThat\u2019s what a panel of some of the state\u2019s largest business organizations and worker groups told state lawmakers during a House COVID-19 subcommittee hearing Wednesday.\n\n\u201cTo ask our employees to enforce a mask mandate under these new conditions or verify vaccine status at the door will further escalate confrontations in our communities and is simply not realistic,\u201d said Amanda Dalton, president of the Northwest Grocery Association, which represents 300 chain and community grocers across Oregon. \u201cWe\u2019re not aware of any other state today taking the card-check approach to the CDC guidance.\u201d\n\nStates have taken varied approaches to the new federal guidance. Some, like New York, are allowing fully vaccinated people to stop wearing masks immediately, while others, like California, are keeping mask requirements in place for now.\n\nOregon Health Authority Director Patrick Allen told lawmakers that the state settled on its approach after consulting businesses, unions and worker groups within the state.\n\nBut businesses and unions pushed back against those assertions.\n\nJess Giannettino Villatoro, political director for Oregon AFL-CIO, and Paloma Sparks, general counsel at Oregon Business and Industry, said their organizations were informed that the rules were coming but were not offered a chance to provide input before the state rolled out the new guidance.\n\n\u201cI would not use the phrase \u2018worked with,\u2019\u201d Sparks said. \u201cHe informed us of what they would be doing and seemed pretty immune to our feedback and our concerns about how this was going to be implemented.\u201d\n\nSeveral of the business groups invited to testify said the state has put business owners in an \u201cimpossible situation\u201d with the new requirements.\n\nThey said Oregon\u2019s failure to issue formal guidance for five days after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s announcement last Thursday created confusion and led to many in the public thinking that mask mandates had already been dropped.\n\nThey said that businesses that continue mandating masks risk losing customers, but few businesses feel comfortable with the alternative, either. They criticized the state for once again asking businesses to enforce public health policy by requiring them to review vaccination cards, without giving them any tools or training, or considering the burden that the new rules will put on frontline workers.\n\nFred Meyer said Thursday that it will continue to require masks in response to Oregon\u2019s new guidance, despite its parent company, Kroger, suspending mask requirements elsewhere in the country.\n\nOregon\u2019s Enchanted Forest amusement park announced Monday that it would delay its reopening plans after some people responded with threats and angry comments to its decision to continue to require masks.\n\nDalton said she heard from a family grocer in Central Oregon as well that said some of its employees had threatened to quit after the way they were treated by customers while trying to enforce the state\u2019s new mask rules.\n\nThe panelists said businesses remain worried that they could open themselves up to litigation by asking for customers\u2019 health information and remain confused on how to effectively implement the state\u2019s guidance.\n\nSome wondered how businesses are supposed to stop customers from showing fake vaccination cards or simply taking off their masks after entering. Others wanted to know whether the state expected businesses to store customers\u2019 vaccination information or force customers to verify their vaccination status every time they shop.\n\n\u201cWe really need clear guidance for our folks,\u201d said Jenny Dresler, legislative and grassroots counsel for the Oregon State Chamber of Commerce. \u201cThey are so confused and so scared of the possibility of lawsuits in this space. The top thing I heard from our members was, \u2018How do we get out of this mess?\u2019\u201d\n\nWorkers groups were similarly concerned about the new guidance.\n\nCourtney Graham, political & electoral strategist at SEIU Local 503, said the guidance will not only put an undue burden on frontline workers, but could put the health of those workers at risk if customers who are not fully vaccinated skirt the rules and forgo masks. Most frontline workers in Oregon didn\u2019t become eligible to receive vaccines themselves until April 5.\n\n\u201cThe new guidance could put some workers in a challenging position,\u201d Graham said. \u201cWorkers who are immunocompromised themselves or live with someone who is, workers with young children and workers who haven\u2019t yet had the opportunity to become fully vaccinated.\u201d\n\nThere was less agreement on how Oregon should change its guidance to address the concerns of businesses and workers.\n\nSome panelists raised the possibility of allowing customers to self-attest to their vaccination status, while others said the state should consider rolling back its guidance to mandate masks indoors until a greater percentage of Oregon\u2019s population is vaccinated. Dalton pointed to other states that have set dates to remove mask mandates rather than rushed to issue new guidance.\n\nWhat\u2019s clear, Dalton said, is that Oregon\u2019s current guidance isn\u2019t working.\n\n\u201cYou have a real problem across the state right now,\u201d Dalton said. \u201cYou have had a real problem since Thursday night.\u201d",

Its plans include a large site in Peterborough, East Anglia.\n\nToni Petersson, Oatly\u2019s chief executive, said demand for its oat milk had \u201ccompletely exploded\u201d during the pandemic with the company currently experiencing \u201ctriple-digit growth on three continents\u201d. The company\u2019s sales doubled from $204m in 2019 to $421m last year, although losses widened from $35.6m to $60.4m.\n\n\u201cWe currently have four factories and by the end of 2023 we\u2019re going to have nine,\u201d said Petersson of its plans after the Nasdaq listing. Production constraints meant that shops often sold out of cartons of Oatly before the weekend, he said: \u201cDemand is no problem \u2026 it is our ability to supply that is the thing.\u201d\n\nIn February the Swedish company revealed it was working on a flotation, and on Wednesday the shares were priced at $17. That was at top of its target range, giving the company an opening valuation of $10bn. It raised $1.1bn in new shares with existing investors cashing in to the tune of $335m. At open the shares rose as high as $22.74.\n\nOatly\u2019s worth has soared over the past year and sales have accelerated, even amid disruption caused by the pandemic. Last summer, it sold a 10th of the company to a group of investors that included Blackstone, Oprah Winfrey and Jay-Z, but that deal valued the business at just $2bn.\n\nThe listing is a big moment for Oatly which, after several decades in the Swedish wilderness, hit the big time thanks to its guerrilla marketing. When one first-time drinker declared \u201cit tastes like shit!\u201d the company put that on its carton. It has also picked a fight with the dairy industry, with Petersson appearing in one of its ads singing \u201cWow, no cow!\u201d\n\nPetersson, now a wealthy man owing to his 1.5% stake in Oatly, said he and other top executives achieved the IPO while working from home in Sweden. He also insisted that despite morphing into a multibillion-pound corporate, the company will not change.\n\n\u201cYeah, we\u2019re gonna be super boring,\u201d Petersson joked, before adding: \u201cOur mission, our purpose is not going to change. It is the opposite. With scale we can have a greater positive impact on the planet.\u201d Its success was based on its ability to connect with consumers and do that \u201cyou have got to be legit\u201d, he added.",

Investors have rushed into major digital currencies such as bitcoin and a growing industry of financial products tied to them, prompting regulators to lay out new rules for a rapidly growing world.\n\nFinancial regulators appointed by President Biden Joe BidenJudge agrees to unseal 2020 ballots in Georgia county for audit George Floyd's family to visit White House on Tuesday Biden: US will provide vaccinations for South Korean service members MORE have recently pledged to crack down on any manipulation or abuse within the cryptocurrency industry, while advocates for the industry insist the government must lay out clear, consistent rules for all to follow.\n\nHere are five reasons cryptocurrencies are spurring action from Washington:\n\nAs stocks blasted to record highs through 2020, major cryptocurrencies exploded right beside them. The price of one bitcoin skyrocketed from roughly $7,300 at the start of 2020 to a peak of $63,503 in mid-April of this year. Other prominent cryptocurrencies such as ethereum and even coins created as jokes such as dogecoin saw similarly meteoric rises, which prompted a cycle of investor enthusiasm driven by soaring prices and prominent onetime supporters such as Elon Musk Elon Reeve MuskChina bans Tesla cars from some government compounds: report Musk tells Moscow he could expand Tesla manufacturing to Russia Business opposition hasn't moved the needle in voting rights fight; sports might MORE.\n\nBut the rally buckled in a major way this week not long after Musk disavowed bitcoin, knocking $30,000 off its price \u2014 two months of growth \u2014 and 40 percent off its value since last Friday.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re a crypto investor, you\u2019ve probably had to deal with major drops in the past. But this time around felt especially painful,\u201d wrote Lule Demmissie, president of Ally Invest, in a Friday research note.\n\n\u201cBitcoin has looked like the classic case of a crowded trade that turned. Investors have jumped from Bitcoin to Ethereum to Dogecoin in search for the hottest trend in the crypto space. This week, crypto holders rushed to the exits, with all three coins down 30% or more from their peaks,\u201d Demmissie added.\n\nMajor banks and investment firms that once refused to touch cryptocurrencies are now accepting digital tokens as an enduring part of the financial sector, helping legitimize the burgeoning technology.\n\nAfter the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) gave the banks it regulates the green light to hold cryptocurrency for clients, U.S. Bank, Bank of New York Mellon and Citibank took steps to offer crypto services. Goldman Sachs, one of the earliest investment banks to embrace cryptocurrency, announced this month its plan to offer bitcoin derivatives amid intense demand for crypto-linked bets, fueling concern among industry skeptics.\n\n\u201cMy broader concern is that these initiatives were not done in full coordination with all stakeholders. Nor do they appear to have been part of a broader strategy related to the regulatory perimeter. I believe addressing both of these tasks should be a priority,\u201d Acting Comptroller of the Currency Michael Hsu said during a House hearing this week.\n\nWhile Wall Street power players have begun to dip their toes in the crypto world, the online trading platforms and applications that grew beside the digital currency boom have hit several technical and political speedbumps.\n\nCoinbase, the biggest cryptocurrency exchange, and other firms experienced outages this week amid the crypto sell-off, and Binance \u2014 another exchange \u2014 limited all but a handful of cryptocurrency options trades amid the frenzy, drawing backlash from users.\n\nThe intense price swings and the technical issues they\u2019ve spawned have prompted more skepticism among Democratic lawmakers about the legitimacy and safety of cryptocurrencies as investment products.\n\nSen. Sherrod Brown Sherrod Campbell BrownDemocrats worry Jan. 6 probe could divert their agenda Sherrod Brown pushes watchdog to keep crypto firms out of banking system Biden faces big decision on Fed leadership MORE (D-Ohio), chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, urged the OCC this week to take a closer look at decisions made by his predecessors to allow some crypto trading and custody firms to offer some banking services nationally.\n\n\u201cA firm that cannot meet the rigorous requirements applicable to other banks should not be allowed to present itself to the public as a bank,\u201d Brown said, calling cryptocurrencies \u201crisky and unproven.\u201d\n\nBut Peter Van Valkenburgh, research director at cryptocurrency think tank Coin Center, countered that the OCC\u2019s supervision is more likely to protect preexisting customers of such firms than drawn in new ones.\n\n\u201cA bunch of people are already using this thing,\" he said. \"Do you want them to use it through a company that's got heavy-duty federal regulation, or do you want them to go and find an international exchange that is licensed anywhere? Because they will.\u201d\n\nSome critics of cryptocurrencies dismiss them as little more than vehicles for money laundering and fraud. While those are far from the only current or potential uses, high-profile instances of crimes involving cryptocurrencies \u2014 including the $5 million in bitcoin ransom received by the alleged Colonial Pipeline hackers \u2014 have stoked concerns about regulatory gaps.\n\nThe cryptocurrency industry doesn\u2019t fall neatly into the jurisdiction of any one state or federal regulator, making it difficult to set uniform standards or crack down on potential crime.\n\nThe Treasury Department is responsible for collecting taxes on cryptocurrency and ensuring compliance with anti-money laundering rules. The Securities and Exchange Commission has jurisdiction over certain investment offerings involving cryptocurrencies, while the Commodity Futures Trading Commission has jurisdiction over other products, partially because digital coins themselves blur the lines between securities and commodities.\n\nAnd while federal bank regulators will monitor how the firms they supervise handle crypto, there is no one federal agency with the authority to regulate spot cryptocurrency exchanges, forcing many firms to get state-by-state certification from money transfer supervisors.\n\n\u201cWhile it's novel, it's incumbent on those regulators to understand it because this stuff is not going away,\u201d said Ethan Silver, partner at law firm Lowenstein Sandler.\n\nWith more investors buying more cryptocurrencies for more money, the IRS has stepped up its efforts to make crypto owners aware of their tax burdens. The agency caused a stir in 2019 when outlining how crypto investors, some unsuspecting, would need to declare income from investments and potentially pay capital gains taxes.\n\nBut the IRS drew even more backlash Thursday after it announced that under President Biden\u2019s plan to bolster tax compliance, individuals would have to report receiving cryptocurrency with a fair market value of more than $10,000, akin to how they currently report cash transactions.\n\nBitcoin fell sharply after the announcement, which evoked fears of steep tax bills or limited future price growth among investors.\n\n\u201cAs long as we're just providing equal treatment between cash and crypto, we're providing needed clarity, and that's almost always positive,\u201d Van Valkenburgh said.",

We also need to get the batteries to do this. We are doing that and you are going to see more about that at the capital market day next Wednesday, but again, we are not in this for a couple of trucks.\u201d\n\nFord hasn\u2019t confirmed the battery pack capacity of the truck yet, but both options are definitely over 100 kWh.\n\nThe company is well aware that if they plan to produce the F-150 Lightning in volume, it is going to need a lot of battery cells.\n\nA supply partnership with SK Innovation was secured early on to supply the cells for the electric F-150 and Ford took it a step further this week with a joint-venture with SK to deploy another 60 GWh of battery cell production capacity in the US.\n\nIn our interview, Palmer hinted at more announcements on the battery front during an event coming on Wednesday.\n\nYou can watch our full interview with Darren Palmer on Youtube or the audio version on the Electrek Podcast (Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Overcast, Pocket Casts, Castro, and RSS):\n\nPalmer also made a point that Ford relies heavily on customer feedback in the development of its vehicles and the F-150 Lightning is no exception.\n\nIt starts with commercial customers who require reliable vehicles at the right price point and retail consumers benefit from that while Ford also listens to them for all the features and niceties that you\u2019d expect in a consumer vehicle.\n\nTherefore, with the F-150 Lightning, Ford made sure that truck buyers would get all the capacity and features they are used to plus all the advantages of electric vehicles.\n\nOne of those features that Ford is betting on is Vehicle-to-Load, which enables F-150 Lightning owners to power their home, a job site, or virtually anything using the truck\u2019s battery pack.\n\nPalmer also explained that Ford is trying not to overwhelm buyers with electrification and it is trying to simplify the process of going electric.\n\nFor example, with the extended range version, Ford is providing an 80-amp charger that enables charging the large battery of the truck overnight.\n\nThe company is also not releasing all the nitty-gritty details of the truck\u2019s electric powertrain, like the kWh capacity of the battery pack, which Palmer believes most people don\u2019t really understand, but he did say that Ford will release all the details, including usable and full battery pack capacity, ahead of production next year.\n\nWe expect Ford to share more details and highlight more features of the F-150 Lightning over the next year \u2013 leading up to the start of production in mid-2022.\n\nSubscribe to Electrek on YouTube for exclusive videos and subscribe to the podcast.",

My guess is that crypto is here to stay, and probably here to stay as a kind of digital gold.\u201d\n\nIf cryptocurrencies became even a third of the total value of gold, Summers said that would be a \u201csubstantial appreciation from current levels\u201d and that means there\u2019s a \u201cgood prospect that crypto will be part of the system for quite a while to come.\u201d\n\nComparing Bitcoin to the yellow metal is common in the crypto community, with various estimates as to whether and how quickly their total market values might equalize.\n\nYassine Elmandjra, crypto analyst at Cathie Wood\u2019s Ark Investment Management LLC, said earlier this month that if gold is assumed to have a market cap of around $10 trillion, \u201cit\u2019s not out of the question that Bitcoin will reach gold parity in the next five years.\u201d With Bitcoin\u2019s market cap around $700 billion, that could mean price appreciation of around 14-fold or more.\n\nBut Summers said cryptocurrencies do not matter to the overall economy and were unlikely to ever serve as a majority of payments.\n\nSummers is on the board of directors of Square Inc. The company said this month that sales in the first quarter more than tripled, driven by skyrocketing Bitcoin purchases through the company\u2019s Cash App.\n\nSummers\u2019 comments were echoed by Nobel laureate Paul Krugman, who doubted crypto\u2019s value as a medium of exchange or stable purchasing power, but said some forms of it may continue to exist as an alternative to gold.\n\n\u201cAre cryptocurrencies headed for a crash sometime soon? Not necessarily,\u201d Krugman wrote in the New York Times. \u201cOne fact that gives even crypto skeptics like me pause is the durability of gold as a highly valued asset.\u201d\n\nSummers also said that President Joe Biden\u2019s administration is heading in the \u201cright direction\u201d by asking companies to pay more tax. He argued policy makers in the past had not been guilty of pursuing \u201ctoo much antitrust\u201d regulation although he warned it would be \u201cbadly wrong\u201d to go after companies just because of increasing market share and profits.Returning to his worry that the U.S. economy risks overheating, Summers said the Federal Reserve should be more aware of the inflationary threat.\u201cI don\u2019t think the Fed is projecting in a way that reflects the potential seriousness of the problem,\u201d he said. \u201cI am concerned that with everything that\u2019s going on, the economy may be a bit charging toward a wall.\u201d\n\nMore stories like this are available on bloomberg.com\n\nSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.",

        "78": "The number of existing home sales plunged in April, surprising economists who had expected last month\u2019s drop to moderate. Real estate experts say this is an indication that shortages of everything from lumber to kitchen appliances are reverberating throughout an already red-hot market \u2014 good news for sellers, but a situation that threatens to price out a growing number of buyers, despite mortgage rates that remain near historic lows.\n\nExisting home sales fell from an annualized 6.01 million to 5.85 million, the National Association of Realtors said on Friday. The consensus had been for a tiny uptick to 6.02 million.\n\nThe plunge can be attributed to a lack of inventory, said Nick Bailey, chief customer officer at RE/MAX. It\u2019s a perfect storm for home buyers: Builders are contending with widespread and unprecedented supply chain choke points just as the swelling population of millennials is seeking to transition into larger homes to accommodate families.\n\n\u201cIt's the millennial population driving this market,\u201d Bailey said. \u201cA lot of them are turning to new construction, but because of labor and supply costs, builders are being very deliberate about how quickly or how slowly they bring things onto the market.\u201d The lumber shortage has been well-documented, but there are a host of other supply chain choke points plaguing home builders, from copper for wiring to PVC pipe \u2014 even for often taken-for-granted inputs like kitchen appliances.\n\nThis combination of factors means that last year\u2019s sharp escalation of home prices is set to continue. According to the National Association of Realtors, the median sales price on an existing-single-family home hit a record $334,500 in March.\n\n\u201cWe have a major housing shortage in America,\u201d said Lawrence Yun, the trade group\u2019s chief economist. The problem predated the arrival of Covid-19, he said, and was greatly exacerbated by a sudden influx of buyers seeking more space while locked down in the early months of the pandemic and a shutdown of construction sites, factories and lumber mills.\n\n\u201cSupply chain issues have added several weeks to the time it takes to build a home,\u201d said John Burns, CEO of John Burns Real Estate Consulting. Big builders bid up prices on the items they need for construction and then pass along those costs \u2014 and then some \u2014 to buyers who are in little position to negotiate given the dearth of available supply, while small builders are often locked out entirely, Burns said.\n\n\u201cSuppliers have to take care of their largest customers first,\u201d he said. \u201cThe surge in demand that is allowing builders to push price, and putting even more strain on the supply chain as the demand for materials has surged.\u201d\n\nEven with much of the American economy returning to normal, those aftereffects will continue to have a long tail, experts predicted. Commerce Department data released earlier this week found that the number of housing starts unexpectedly tumbled to an annualized 1.57 million, compared with expectations of about 1.7 million.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen a continuation of appreciation in most markets,\u201d Bailey said. Too many buyers chasing after too few properties is triggering bidding wars, and, in some neighborhoods, competition is so fierce that many homes are sold before they even hit the market, he said.\n\nAccording to Zillow, nearly half of the people who sold homes last month accepted an offer within a week. \u201cAs millennials age into the peak years of homeownership, we expect that the demand for housing will be very strong in the coming years,\u201d said Chris Glynn, Zillow\u2019s principal economist.\n\nWhile low interest rates are contributing to the continued appreciation, even that can\u2019t always make a mortgage a financial reality for buyers, Glynn said. \u201cThe challenge interest rates can\u2019t solve is the one barrier to entry \u2014 down payments,\u201d he said. \u201cPrices rising definitely adds to the challenge of coming up with that down payment,\u201d he said. Programs that let buyers put down less than the traditional 20 percent can help, but in some markets, he said, would-be buyers find that this puts the cost of a monthly mortgage payment out of reach.\n\n\u201cGiven the housing shortage and strong demand \u2014 there's nothing to suggest home prices will be falling,\u201d Yun said.\n\nYun suggested that President Joe Biden\u2019s infrastructure plan should incorporate initiatives aimed at getting buyers into homes.\n\n\u201cIt's not a good outcome for the country,\" Yun said. \"We want to make sure that people who are making financially responsible decisions should have access to homeownership. We need to build more, and more consistently, so home prices come down,\u201d he said.",

        "82": "Whether the price is surging or dipping, Bitcoin stays a hot topic.\n\nThe price of the famously volatile digital currency fell nearly 30% at one point Wednesday after the China Banking Association warned member banks of the risks associated with digital currencies. The decline narrowed to below 10% that same afternoon, but Bitcoin had still lost about $70 billion in market value in 24 hours.\n\nBitcoin has lost about 38% of its value since April 13 when it hit a high of more than $64,800, according to Coindesk. The China warning was just the latest headwind: Before Wednesday, Tesla\u2019s decision to not accept the digital currency as payment for cars \u2014 after it said it would \u2014 and murmurings in Washington about tighter regulation of digital currencies had put pressure on Bitcoin. The price is still up about 31% in 2021 and nearly 300% from a year ago.\n\nHere\u2019s a look at Bitcoin and digital currencies in general:\n\nBitcoin is a digital currency that is not tied to a bank or government and allows users to spend money anonymously. The coins are created by users who \u201cmine\u201d them by lending computing power to verify other users\u2019 transactions. They receive Bitcoins in exchange.\n\nThe coins also can be bought and sold on exchanges with U.S. dollars and other currencies. Some businesses take Bitcoin as payment, and a number of financial institutions allow it in their clients\u2019 portfolios, but overall mainstream acceptance is still limited.\n\nBitcoin on the upswing:Bitcoin, cryptocurrencies rebound amid volatile week of trading\n\nChicago Tribune has a new owner:Tribune investors approve hedge fund takeover, shifting control of Chicago Tribune\n\nBitcoins are basically lines of computer code that are digitally signed each time they travel from one owner to the next. Transactions can be made anonymously, making the currency popular with libertarians as well as tech enthusiasts, speculators \u2014 and criminals.\n\nBitcoins have to be stored in a digital wallet, either online through an exchange like Coinbase, or offline on a hard drive using specialized software. According to Coinbase, there are about 18.7 million Bitcoins in circulation and only 21 million will ever exist. The reason for that is unclear, and where all the Bitcoins are is anyone\u2019s guess.\n\nWHAT HAPPENED TO THE PRICE?\n\nOn Wednesday, a statement posted on the Chinese Banking Association\u2019s website said financial institutions should \u201cresolutely refrain\u201d from providing services using digital currencies because of their volatility.\n\nVirtually every cryptocurrency fell after the industry group\u2019s statement.\n\nAs of 4:15 p.m. eastern time that day , Bitcoin was down more than 7% at around $40,310 per coin. Most cryptocurrencies lost between 7% and 22% of their value and shares of Coinbase dropped 5.4%.\n\nIt\u2019s not unusual for the value of Bitcoin to change by thousands of dollars in a short time period, though swings totaling around $20,000 in one day are extreme. On the last trading day of 2020, Bitcoin closed just under $30,000. In mid-April, it flirted with $65,000.\n\nYes, and a fairly big one. Musk announced in February that his electric car company Tesla had invested $1.5 billion in Bitcoin. In March, Tesla began accepting Bitcoin as payment. Those actions contributed to the run-up in Bitcoin\u2019s price, and Musk also promoted the digital currency Dogecoin, which also spiked in value.\n\nHowever, Musk reversed course in just a short time, saying last week that Tesla would stop accepting Bitcoin because of the potential environmental damage that can result from Bitcoin mining. The announcement sent Bitcoin falling below $50,000 and set the tone for the big pullback recently in most cryptocurrencies.\n\nA number of Bitcoin fans pushed back on Musk\u2019s reasoning. Fellow billionaire Mark Cuban said that gold mining is much more damaging to the environment than the mining of Bitcoin.\n\nA 2019 study by the Technical University of Munich and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology found that the Bitcoin network generates an amount of CO2 similar to a large Western city or an entire developing country like Sri Lanka. But a University of Cambridge study last year estimated that on average, 39% of \u201cproof-of-work\u201d crypto mining was powered by renewable energy, primarily hydroelectric energy.\n\nThere had been some concern among Bitcoin investors that Tesla would sell some or all of its Bitcoin holdings, but Musk indicated in a tweet Wednesday that Tesla was sticking with its investment.\n\nBut some companies are using Bitcoin?\n\nThe digital payment company Square and its CEO Jack Dorsey, also the CEO of Twitter, have been big proponents of Bitcoin.\n\nOverstock.com also accepts Bitcoin, and in February, BNY Mellon, the oldest bank in the U.S., said it would include digital currencies in the services it provides to clients. And Mastercard said it would start supporting \u201cselect crypto currencies\u201d on its network.\n\nBitcoin has become popular enough that more than 300,000 transactions typically occur in an average day, according to Bitcoin wallet site blockchain.info. Still, its popularity is low compared with cash and credit cards.\n\nIs there skepticism around Bitcoin?\n\nYes, plenty of it.\n\nTracking Bitcoin\u2019s price is obviously easier than trying to figure out its value, which is why so many institutions, experts and traders are skeptical about it and cryptocurrency in general.\n\nDigital currencies were seen as replacements for paper money, but that hasn\u2019t happened so far. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has said the central bank prefers to call crypto coins \u201ccrypto assets,\u201d because their volatility undermines their ability to store value, a basic function of a currency.\n\nWhile some banks and financial services companies are getting in on it, others are staying away.\n\nRegulators aren\u2019t very worried about a possible crash in digital currencies dragging down the rest of the financial system or economy.\n\nEven with the recent sell-off, digital currencies have a market value of about $1.72 trillion, according to the website coinmarketcap.com. But that pales compared with the $46.9 trillion stock market, $41.3 trillion residential real estate market and nearly $21 trillion Treasury market at the start of the year.\n\nThe European Central Bank said Wednesday that the risk of cryptocurrencies affecting the financial system\u2019s stability looks \u201climited at present.\u201d In large part, that\u2019s because they\u2019re still not widely used for payments and institutions under its purview still have little exposure to crypto-linked instruments.\n\nEarlier this month, the Federal Reserve said a survey of market contacts found roughly one in five cited cryptocurrencies as a potential shock to the system over the next 12 to 18 months. That\u2019s a turnaround from the fall, when a similar survey found none mentioning cryptocurrencies.\n\nHow much oversight is there?\n\nWashington officials have been talking about regulating digital currencies more, and worries about a heavier hand have played a role in the recent swoon in prices.\n\nGary Gensler, who took over as chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission last month, has said that cryptocurrency markets would benefit from more oversight to protect investors.\n\nIn a hearing before the House\u2019s financial services committee earlier this month, Gensler said neither the SEC nor the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which he used to head, has a \u201cregulatory framework\u201d for trading on cryptocurrency exchanges yet. He said he thought Congress would ultimately have to address it because \u201cthere\u2019s really not protection against fraud or manipulation.\u201d\n\nHow did Bitcoin come to be?\n\nIt\u2019s a mystery. Bitcoin was launched in 2009 by a person or group of people operating under the name Satoshi Nakamoto. Bitcoin was then adopted by a small clutch of enthusiasts. Nakamoto dropped off the map as bitcoin began to attract widespread attention. But proponents say that doesn\u2019t matter: The currency obeys its own internal logic.\n\nAssociated Press Reporters Matt Ott, Ken Sweet and Stan Choe in New York contributed.",
        "83": "(CNN) As the Covid-19 vaccine rollout continues in the United States, with people ages 12 and older receiving their shots, vaccine makers are now preparing for a next possible phase: booster doses.\n\nCurrently three coronavirus vaccines are authorized for emergency use in the United States -- the two-dose Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine for ages 12 and older, the two-dose Moderna vaccine for ages 18 and older and the single-dose Johnson & Johnson vaccines for ages 18 and older.\n\nResearchers and health officials suspect that the immunity against Covid-19 these vaccines elicit in the body might wane over long periods of time -- say, possibly, after a year or more -- and might not protect as well against coronavirus variants that could emerge and evolve.\n\nTherefore, a vaccinated person might need a booster dose of vaccine to stay protected against the original coronavirus strain and newly emerging variants -- somewhat similar to how a tetanus booster is recommended every 10 years or different flu vaccines are recommended each year.\n\nWill booster doses or new vaccines be needed?\n\nIn the case of Covid-19 vaccines it remains unknown for how long immune protection lasts, but vaccine developers and health officials know it may not be forever -- and that emerging variants could escape immunity.\n\n\"There is a little nuance with Covid-19 vaccines,\" Moss said.\n\nWhile typical booster doses use same vaccine someone previously received to remind the immune system about immunity to a pathogen, any future boosters for the Covid-19 shot could use different vaccines altogether.\n\nBut Americans should prepare to have a Covid-19 vaccine booster shot within a year, US Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy told CNN's Wolf Blitzer on Thursday.\n\n\"We have to see how long the protection lasts. We know it lasts at least six months, but we'll have to see,\" Murthy said. \"It's very possible, though, and people should be prepared for the fact that we may need a booster within a year.\"\n\nHow often will you need a Covid-19 booster?\n\nDespite such predictions, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told CNN the bottom line is \"we don't know.\"\n\n\"We're preparing for the eventuality that we might need boosters, but I think we've got to be careful not to let the people know that inevitably, x number of months from now, everyone's going to need a booster. That's just not the case,\" Fauci, chief medical adviser to President Joe Biden, said at a Washington Post Live event. \"We may not need it for quite a while.\"\n\nScientists at a number of companies that make Covid-19 vaccines have also predicted the need for boosters within a year -- but the scientific community is not in widespread agreement on this.\n\n\"We're making extrapolations\" from incomplete data, Fauci told The Washington Post on Thursday.\n\nSo far, studies have shown that mRNA vaccines -- those made by Pfizer and Moderna -- maintain more than 90% efficacy six months after getting vaccinated. And scientists say it's likely much longer.\n\nOther studies have looked at antibodies in the lab. While a decline is expected over time, Fauci told the Post \"the steepness of that slope is unclear right now.\"\n\nExperts say it is also unclear how these antibody levels correlate with real-world immunity, and to what extent other parts of the immune system -- such as T cells -- could factor into protection.\n\nWhat happens if you skip the booster?\n\nWhether booster coronavirus vaccine doses are modified or not, missing a booster dose -- if one is recommended in the future -- could leave someone less protected against Covid-19.\n\n\"A person who skipped a booster is placing themselves at higher risk of getting infected, and getting disease from the SARS-Coronavirus-2, but I would also expect that they're going to have some partial immunity and so they may be protected against more severe disease,\" Moss said. SARS-CoV-2 is the virus that causes Covid-19.\n\n\"It's just a function of how much their immunity has waned or how different a variant is,\" he said. \"They're just at higher risk of infection and disease than someone who got the booster, but they have more immunity than someone who was never vaccinated.\"\n\nScientists are also currently investigating whether it makes a difference if someone gets the same type of vaccine as a booster as the original dose administered.\n\n\"This question of mixing and matching certainly is relevant to booster doses,\" Moss said. \"It's also relevant to any two-dose vaccine schedule, and it's also an area of active research.\"\n\nResearchers in the United Kingdom reported last week that people who got mixed doses of coronavirus vaccines -- receiving a different vaccine type as a second dose than the first dose -- appear to be more likely to experience mild side effects such as fever, chills, fatigue or headache.\n\nAs for booster doses in the future, \"I can very much envision a situation in which people might get a very different type of vaccine for that booster dose than they had originally,\" Moss said. \"The big question I have, I guess, is how much underlying scientific evidence are we going to have to support that to actually make it a recommendation? That I don't know yet, but it's certainly likely to happen by default, just because perhaps the original vaccine is not available.\"\n\nAll three companies that currently have authorized coronavirus vaccines in the United States -- Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson -- are investigating the potential use of boosters.\n\n\"We are right now in the middle of these trials and the data are coming as we speak,\" Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla told Axios during a virtual event on Wednesday.\n\n\"The data that I see coming, they are supporting the notion that likely there will be a need for a booster somewhere between eight and 12 months,\" Bourla said. \" But that remains to be seen and I believe in one, two months we will have enough data to speak about it with much higher scientific certainty.\"\n\nThe first dose of Pfizer's coronavirus vaccine in the United States was administered on December 14, 2020 -- five months ago. As time goes on, if people received their second dose of vaccine eight months ago, \"they may need a third one,\" Bourla said. \"This could be coming sooner than later, I believe from September, October. But this is something, again, that the data need to confirm.\"\n\nModerna is currently conducting booster shot trials too.\n\nThe fight against the coronavirus pandemic is expected to continue through next year due to the emergence of variants, Dr. Stephen Hoge, president of Moderna, said during an earnings call earlier this month.\n\n\"We think this is just the beginning,\" Hoge said. \"Therefore, we're committed as a company to make as many updates to the vaccine, to add as many variants as we think are necessary, to ensure that when people receive a booster, it provides the broadest immune protection against the widest range of variants.\"\n\nJohnson & Johnson is also looking into the potential for boosters.\n\n\"We have ongoing and planned trials that will aid our assessment of the need for, and timing of, booster doses of our vaccine,\" according to an emailed statement Johnson & Johnson sent to CNN on Thursday.\n\nJohnson & Johnson's coronavirus vaccine, along with Pfizer's, Moderna's, and four others, are being tested as seasonal boosters in a study called Cov-Boost being conducted by the UK's National Institute for Health Research and the University of Southhampton.\n\n\"In the US, I think it will be the booster for everyone, particularly if we get it out late in the third quarter,\" Erck told CNN last week. \"It's going to be time to start boosting -- whether it's six months or at a year point.\"\n\nWho has to OK the Covid-19 booster shots?\n\nThe decision to use Covid-19 boosters is expected to involve two agencies -- the US Food and Drug Administration and the CDC -- and the regulatory process to get the shots into arms could vary depending on whether the booster is the same vaccine that was originally used or is a modified version.\n\n\"So, if it's the same vaccine, my understanding is that what would have to happen is that the CDC would have to recommend an additional dose with details around when that should occur,\" Moss said.\n\nIf it's a modified vaccine, \"this is where things get interesting and I don't think we quite know,\" he said, but added that the regulatory process could be similar to what happens with flu vaccines each year.\n\n\"Technically, whenever a vaccine like that is modified, it's often considered a new vaccine and has to go through the whole process again. But there is a precedent, obviously, with influenza virus vaccines, not to do that,\" Moss said. \"So, the influenza vaccine each year doesn't have to go through a large Phase 3 trial.\"\n\nThat's because the vaccine technology stays the same, and the only change is the flu virus itself that the vaccine targets to elicit immunity to a specific flu virus strain that's circulating.\n\nMoss said that's what he expects could happen with modified coronavirus vaccines.\n\n\"At this time, available information suggests that the FDA-authorized vaccines remain effective in protecting the American public against currently circulating strains of SARS-CoV-2. However, if there is an emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variant(s) in the U.S. that are moderately or fully resistant to the antibody response elicited by the current generation of COVID-19 vaccines, it may be necessary to tailor the vaccines to the variant(s),\" an FDA spokesperson told CNN on Thursday.\n\n\"Further discussions will be necessary to decide whether in the future, modified COVID-19 vaccines may be authorized without the need for clinical studies,\" according to the guidance. But overall, vaccine developers are \"encouraged\" to perform exploratory studies on modified vaccines to boost immune responses.",

Partly because, according to Dutch laws, the minimum wage must be in euros.\n\nMore than 1,000 people will get exposure to bitcoin, Immensus Group co-owner Jonathan Gurevich told The Block. \"Part of these people work for us (16 Domino's Pizza stores and some restaurants), and part of these people work for our payroll companies,\" said Gurevich.\n\nImmensus wants to motivate its young staff, mostly school-going, to get familiar with the financial world with this initiative, Gurevich told The Block. The company also intends to retain and attract new staff, he said.\n\nImmensus has partnered with Dutch crypto broker BTC Direct for the effort, meaning BTC Direct will convert euros into bitcoin for Immensus's staff.\n\nThe bitcoin payment method is optional for eligible staff. Gurevich said that even if some employees learn about personal money management, \"we would already achieve something very important.\"\n\nBitcoin transaction costs will be borne by Immensus itself, said Gurevich.\n\nSince salaries only above a minimum wage would be qualified for bitcoin payments, those amounts would be negligible. \"For someone who works like 9 hours per week, they will be able to put at least put \u20ac5 per month into bitcoin,\" Gurevich told The Block. \"On average, people would be able to put \u20ac5 to \u20ac250 in bitcoin from their salaries,\" he said.\n\nBTC Direct also pays its employees a part of their salaries in bitcoin for the last three years.\n\nThe firm's current headcount is 80, and \"almost everybody\" has opted for the bitcoin payment option, BTC Direct's marketing manager Toon Schraven told The Block.\n\nBesides Immensus, BTC Direct is looking to work with more companies for the bitcoin salary option. Schraven said BTC Direct is \"closing some partnerships with a couple of major salary infrastructure companies\" but declined to name those firms as the deals are under process.\n\nMay 22 marks Bitcoin Pizza Day because, 11 years ago, on this day, bitcoin was used as a form of payment for the first time. A developer named Laszlo Hanyecz had bought two Papa John's pizzas with 10,000 bitcoin on May 22, 2010. Those bitcoins are worth now more than $385 million at the time of writing.",
        "85": "AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc (NYSE: AMC) has announced that Chinese conglomerate Dalian Wanda Group Co. has sold off nearly all its shares in the U.S.-based theater company.\n\nWhat Happened: Wanda, which had been AMC's largest shareholder, sold off most of its shares on the open market. AMC now has some 3 million individual shareholders, and no single entity has an ownership stake above 10%, AMC said in its statement on Friday.\n\nAMC CEO Adam Aron credited Wanda with helping to make AMC the largest movie theater operator in the world.\n\nThe sale is part of a broader set of moves by Wanda. The conglomerate has been pulling back its sizable overseas investments after having paid high prices for many assets and now is struggling with a heavy load of debt.\n\nBut the sales though did come at a favorable time for Wanda. According to Deadline, the sales took place between May 13 and May 18 when they were trading for about $14 a share. Though AMC's share price dropped 11% in the past week, it still is up 501% year-to-date.\n\nWanda still holds 10,000 shares for a stake of just 0.002%. Wanda reported a 6.8% stake in April and a stake of more than a third of the company in October, according to Bloomberg.\n\nGameStop Saga Beneficiary: AMC was among the top other stocks targeted in the GameStop Corp (NYSE: GME) short squeeze drama that began unfolding in January. The moves led by the WallStreetBets Reddit group pushed up the price of targeted stocks and caused huge losses among short sellers that had bet against the stocks.\n\nWanda bought AMC in 2012 for $2.6 billion, and then took the company public in 2013, retaining a majority of the total outstanding shares.",
        "86": "An analytics firm identified the bitcoin wallet used by the ransomware group behind the Colonial Pipeline attack and the massive payments received from victims.\n\nThe gang\u2019s wallet received a 75 BTC (bitcoin) payment, or roughly $5 million, made by Colonial Pipeline on May 8 following the cyberattack on its operations, according to a report from blockchain analytics firm Elliptic.\n\nThe Colonial Pipeline shutdown led to widespread fuel shortages in the U.S. and has been described as the worst cyberattack on critical U.S. infrastructure to date. DarkSide, which the FBI confirmed as being behind the attacks, is believed to have originated in Eastern Europe, likely Russia. The group's ransomware was first spotted in August 2020.\n\nThe firm also tracked a ransomware bitcoin payment made by Brenntag, a large chemical distribution company in Germany, totaling roughly $ 4.4 million.\n\nThe group's wallet has been active since March 4, 2021, and has received 57 payments from 21 different wallets, according to Elliptic.\n\nIn total, the DarkSide wallet received Bitcoin transactions since March totaling $17.5 million, Elliptic said. The firm said the majority of the payment was moved out the wallet on May 9.\n\nA portion of the payments was sent to a small group of exchanges. One exchange was identified as Hydra, \"the world\u2019s largest darknet marketplace, servicing customers in Russia and neighboring countries,\" according to Elliptic.\n\nHydra offers \"cash-out services\" along with narcotics, hacking tools and fake IDs, the report said.\n\n\"These allow Bitcoin to be converted into gift vouchers, prepaid debit cards or cash Rubles. If you\u2019re a Russian cybercriminal and you want to cash-out your crypto, then Hydra is an attractive option,\" Elliptic said.\n\nDarkSide, which has since claimed it would cease operations, brought in a cool $90 million in just nine months from an estimated 47 victims, according to another report from Elliptic.\n\nSo far, 99 organizations have been infected with the DarkSide ransomware, \"suggesting that approximately 47% of victims paid a ransom, and that the average payment was $1.9 million,\" Elliptic said, citing a tweet by DarkTracer.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\nBecause of the large sums paid out by victims, ransomware has evolved into a big business that mirrors traditional business models.\n\nDarkSide is a prime example of Ransomware as a Service (RaaS), Elliptic said, echoing longstanding legitimate models such as SaaS or Software as a Service.\n\n\"In this operating model, the malware is created by the ransomware developer, while the ransomware affiliate is responsible for infecting the target computer system and negotiating the ransom payment with the victim organization,\" Elliptic said.\n\n\"This new business model has revolutionized ransomware, opening it up to those who do not have the technical capability to create malware, but are willing and able to infiltrate a target organization,\" according to the analytics firm.",

        "90": "The largest dating apps in the U.S. are banding together in support of Covid-19 vaccines, in the hopes that it'll be a hot vax summer. For the uninitiated, hot vax summer plays on the idea that once single Americans get their coronavirus vaccines, there will be a surge in dating, hookups and overall social opportunities due to all the pent-up demand. (You may also know it as shot girl summer.) Match Group's Hinge, Tinder, OKCupid, BLK, Chispa, Match and Plenty of Fish users will be able to share their vaccine status and get some premium benefits. Bumble and Badoo will also be able to note whether they're vaccinated, and receive some complementary credits. Bumble's and Match Group's latest earnings reports already indicated what all of the social media anecdotes are saying -- people want to hook up again. Though, Match executives put it another way in its letter to shareholders, calling this the \"summer of love.\" In its earnings release, Match said it anticipates total revenue of $680 million to $690 million in the second quarter. That would represent 22% to 24% year-over-year growth. Additionally, the company expects EBITDA of $255 million to $260 million this next quarter. \"The vaccination rates and control over the Covid cases these last few months have resulted in our users feeling more confident about their dating lives,\" Match CEO Shar Dubey said in a call with investors. Bumble estimates total revenue in the range of $175 million to $178 million for the second quarter, up 31% year-over-year at the midpoint of the range. That's also slightly better than analysts surveyed by Refinitiv expected, though some analysts considered it overly cautious. It also anticipates full year revenue in the range of $724 million to $734 million, raising its guidance. Bumble CEO Whitney Wolfe Herd told investors the company was seeing \"meaningful pent-up demand as economic and health improvements approve across regions.\" With a busy summer in mind, dating companies, like Match, Bumble and Grindr, are able to reap the benefits. \"We got a kick out of hot vax summer,\" Grindr's Director of Marketing Alex Black told CNBC. \"Activity is definitely up and we definitely expect that to increase going into the summer.\" It's not that people didn't use dating apps while isolating at home this past year. Despite the pandemic keeping people from in-person meetups, dating apps saw a jump in usage during lockdowns. Dating companies were able to shift their businesses to put an emphasis on virtual dating during the pandemic, so people could fill up their evenings with Zoom dates and phone calls. Bumble's first quarter revenue increased year-over-year to $170.7 million, up from $79.1 million for the first quarter of 2020. Analysts were expecting $164.6 million. Total paying users also increased 30% to 2.8 million. For its first quarter, Match reported adjusted earnings per share of 57 cents on revenue of $668 million. Analysts expected 40 adjusted EPS of 40 cents on revenue of $651 million. Average subscribers increased 12% to 11.1 million, up from 9.9 million in the prior year quarter. Daily average swipes were up 24%, daily average messages gained 19%, and conversations were 32% longer compared to the baseline period before Covid, Match said. Hinge is on pace to double its revenue in 2021. \"Stronger than expected 1Q21 results show growing momentum with reopening,\" Truist Securities analysts wrote in a recent note on dating apps.\n\nA reacceleration of the economy and a willingness to meet up with strangers again will likely push companies' growth even further, Jordana Abraham, co-host of the popular dating podcast \"U Up?\" told CNBC. Now that more than 270 million vaccine doses have been administered in the U.S., the people who took breaks from dating over the pandemic (tired of endless swiping or remote dating) are ready to get back out there. Often, an app is behind meet ups. \"People have felt this fear of being in physical contact with people, this fear of going out and meeting anyone new,\" Abraham said. \"And as people across the country start to get vaccinated, there's like something in the air. It's the sense of hopefulness, in the sense of, you know, the idea that they're going to be able to get back to that physical intimacy which so many people have been craving.\" Bumble told investors that it was already seeing signs of increased engagement in the U.S. People who had opted out of the app during the pandemic are starting to come back, and people who stayed are engaging even more. \"Of course people who took a break are definitely coming back,\" Grindr's Black said. The company is seeing growth among new users and a return of those who are logging back in for the first time in a while. Kathryn, a 27-year-old from Chicago, said she's been on-and-off of Hinge and Bumble since the pandemic restricted nearly all of the ways to meet people in person. (As she put it: \"at bars, at work, Uber Pools, the wine section of Target, etc.\"). Now that she's vaccinated, she's comfortable going on more dates that aren't virtual and is looking for casual relationships. \"I'm not looking to immediately reenter the world and settle into a serious relationship,\" Kathryn told CNBC in an email, asking that her last name not be used so she could speak freely about her dating life. \"I don't know if that's the common sentiment though. A lot of people may have realized after all this time alone at home that they'd like someone stable to be there if and when something like this happens again.\"\n\nIt's a similar story for Jordan, a 24-year-old from Boston. She's been using Hinge and Bumble, and had been seeking out a serious relationship before the pandemic. However, after spending a year living alone and becoming fully vaccinated, she said she's leaning more toward casual relationships, wanting to meet more people. Most places also still haven't returned to normal, so people are relying on apps to continue meeting people. \"Since my area is still re-opening, it feels like I'm in limbo, where I can go places but can't necessarily go to the types of events/activities where I usually meet people (ex. bars, concerts) or COVID restrictions limit socialization at the places I can go (ex. local outdoor events, museums, gym),\" she said in an email. Bumble's Wolfe Herd told CNBC's \"TechCheck\" that as people come out of the pandemic, they've realized what they're looking for. Grindr is ramping up its marketing and advertising spend in anticipation of a return to normal. The company is also planning a handful of in-person events for later in the summer, going off of local health guidelines. Bumble may also boost its marketing spend, depending on pandemic recovery. Of course, it all depends on whether pandemic conditions continue to improve. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said fully vaccinated people no longer need to wear a face mask or stay six feet away from others in most settings, whether outdoors or indoors, which is a huge vote of confidence for singles. People don't want to just be protected against the coronavirus. A similar story has been playing out with U.S. condom sales this past quarter. Male condom sales dipped over the year, since fewer people were having sex, but now that restrictions are easing and people are vaccinated, sales are back up. Sales jumped 23.4% to $37 million during the four weeks ending April 18 compared year-over-year, according to the latest figures from market research firm IRI and reported by CNN. Trojan condom-maker Church & Dwight said 2021 could be \"promising\" for sales. Condoms are expected to deliver year-over-year growth as society opens up and consumers have greater mobility, the company's CEO Matthew Farrell said on an April 29 call with investors. Durex-maker Reckitt Benckiser said in its April 28 earnings report the segment delivered double-digit revenue growth in the quarter, led by strong growth in China due to an easing of social distancing restrictions. \"Looser 'stay at home' restrictions in China, compared to the first quarter of 2020, have for example, helped drive strong growth in our sexual wellbeing category. Over time, we would expect this recovery to be replicated in other markets where lockdowns have led to temporarily reduced demand,\" the company said.",

Breeze Airways will finally start flights on May 27 and aims to put a \"seriously nice\" and tech-focused spin on ultra-low-cost flying just in time for the summer travel season.\n\nThe first flight will depart from Tampa, Florida bound for Charleston, South Carolina, and continue on to Hartford, Connecticut. It's the first of 39 routes that Breeze will launch between May 27 and July 22, connecting underserved cities throughout the US with non-stop flights to the places leisure travelers want to be.\n\nRead More: JetBlue founder David Neeleman reveals how his new airline can succeed by flying weird routes for low prices\n\nBut if followers of Neeleman are expecting a 2021-reboot of JetBlue, they'll be sadly mistaken. Breeze will operate under an ultra-low-cost business model where nearly everything from a seat assignment to checked baggage will cost extra. It's slated to be almost the complete opposite of JetBlue.\n\nHere's what travelers can expect from Breeze.\n\nA route network spanning from the Atlantic Ocean to San Antonio, Texas\n\nBreeze plans to take advantage of the leisure travel boom in the US by connecting smaller, underserved cities with non-stop flights to vacation and tourist destinations.\n\nThe cities of Tampa, Florida; Norfolk, Virginia; and New Orleans, Louisiana will be the first four bases for the airline from which most of its flights will either start or end.\n\nBetween New Orleans and:\n\nBreeze will also fly between many of the cities it serves outside of its four main bases. Those routes include:\n\u2022 Between Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and Hartford, Connecticut starting July 22; and\n\nBreeze plans to operate two types of aircraft this summer: the Embraer E190 and Embraer E195. Both are near-identical and will offer a lot of the same amenities but will differ in their seating arrangements.\n\nThe aircraft will only feature economy seats and will be split between standard legroom \"nice\" seats and extra-legroom \"nicer\" seats, which come at a premium.\n\nBreeze's smaller Embraer E190, which many JetBlue flyers will recognize, will carry 108 seats. Nice seats on the E190 will offer 29 inches of legroom, compared to JetBlue's 32 inches, and nicer seats will offer between 33 and 39 inches of legroom.\n\nThe larger Embraer E195 aircraft will carry 118 seats and legroom at each will be greater. Nice seats on the aircraft offer 31 inches of legroom while nicer seats will offer between 34 and 39.\n\nSeeking out the E195 aircraft won't be easy as there are only three of those aircraft versus 13 E190s.\n\nBreeze plans to charge incredibly cheap fares for its flights, and that means there will be lots of fees to pay for extras.\n\nFlyers will have to pay to bring a bag larger than a purse or backpack. The fees, however, are lower than most airlines charge at only $20, regardless of carrying on or checking a bag, but increase to $25 if the flight is longer than three hours.\n\nIf a bag is checked at the airport, it will incur a $50 fee. And another $50 fee will be charged if a bag is added by Breeze airport staff.\n\nSecuring an advance seat assignment will also incur a fee, with prices starting at $10. But there are no middle seats on Breeze's Embraer aircraft so those that don't pay up will either be assigned an aisle or window seat for free.\n\nFamilies with children under 12 can also select advance seats for free.\n\nPrinting a boarding pass at the airport will incur a $3 fee per customer and a $9 fee per customer if helped by Breeze airport staff.\n\nWhat won't incur a fee, however, are changes and cancellations. Breeze fares are fully changeable and cancelable up to 15 minutes before departure.\n\nTravelers that cancel a ticket will have up to 24 months to use its value.\n\nBreeze started a unique work-study to recruit its flight attendants that saw the airline partner with Utah Valley University and allow its online students to work as cabin crew. The degree-seeking students will work the airline's flights by day and take online classes by night.\n\nIn return, the students-turned-cabin-crew will earn $6,000 in tuition reimbursement, a monthly stupid of $1,200, and only have to work for 15 days out of the month, among other benefits. What they won't be given is a full-time job at Breeze at the end of their academic career, and will have to reapply for a full-time position or find work elsewhere.\n\nBut not all of Breeze's cabin crew will be students. The airline opened up the program to non-student applicants after lower than expected recruitment numbers.\n\nSara Nelson, president of the Association of Flight Attendants-CWA union, told Bloomberg that the program could pose safety issues due to the potential age of the applicants. Breeze's minimum age for hiring flight attendants is 18 years old.\n\nBut the airline stood by its flight attendant training program that has been approved by the Department of Transportation, saying that all of its flight attendants will be trained and capable of performing the required duties.\n\n\"If you're a fully trained flight attendant, you're a fully trained flight attendant,\" airline spokesperson Gareth Edmondson-Jones told Insider. \"It's not like if you're 18 years old, you can't be a flight attendant.\"\n\nEntertainment will be available through mobile devices\n\nBreeze aircraft will not feature the seatback screens for which Neeleman made JetBlue famous. But in-flight entertainment will still be offered through mobile devices, powered by Global Eagle.\n\nOn-demand television shows, games, and a real-time flight map will be offered. Live television will not be available.\n\nMore than 150 shows will be available to watch and content will be updated quarterly.\n\nIn-flight WiFi won't be available on Breeze's Embraer aircraft but the service will be offered in the fall on the airline's Airbus A220 aircraft.\n\nJetBlue is known for offering brand-name snacks and so will Breeze. Kind bars and Utz pretzels will both be served onboard but the airline hasn't said whether they'll be free of charge.\n\nBreeze has also not given any information on whether a drink service will be offered.\n\nFares will be low, but not the lowest\n\nBreeze is launching its first 39 routes with fares as low as $39. There's no competition on 95 percent of Breeze's routes so direct comparisons aren't available but other ultra-low-cost carriers routinely offer flights for lower fares.\n\nFrontier Airlines, for example, offers fares as low as $15 sometimes on its East Coast flights. Spirit Airlines similarly offers fares less than Breeze's introductory rates.\n\nAnd only a certain number of $39 fares will be available. Once they're gone, fares will jump depending on how many seats have been sold.",

McDonald-Eckersall began protesting at a McDonald's distribution center at Hemel Hempstead, a town northwest of London, at 5 a.m. local time (midnight ET). Police arrived on the scene around three hours later, McDonald-Eckersall told CNN, but she added the atmosphere was \"very relaxed.\" McDonald's exec: The food industry needs to act now to cut greenhouse gas emissions We've had really positive conversations with workers, lots of them taking selfies with the clown car and big burger, so that's been enjoyable,\" she said. \"People are open to hearing why we're here.\" Animal Rebellion, a sister group to the environmental movement Extinction Rebellion, has not yet heard from McDonald's, McDonald-Eckersall said. The American corporation said its distribution centers were facing disruption. \"We are assessing the impact on deliveries to our restaurants and to menu items,\" a McDonald's spokesperson told CNN. \"We apologise to our customers for any disappointment caused.\" Bamboo towers blocked distribution centers which serve 3.5 million customers, according to Animal Rebellion. The spokesperson declined to say whether McDonald's would open a dialogue with Animal Rebellion. McDonald's expects to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 150 million tons by 2030 and co-founded the Global Roundtable for Sustainable Beef in 2011, which aims to improve the sustainability of the global beef supply chain.

However, it doesn't disclose specific revenue for cloud units including OCI, and only said that OCI grew 100% over the same period of 2020.\n\nMagouyrk, a former Amazon software development engineer who joined Oracle as an individual contributor in 2014, quickly impressed Oracle Chairman Larry Ellison and CEO Safra Catz with his ability to deliver results quickly, leading to his rapid ascent through the ranks to preside over Oracle Cloud Infrastructure.\n\nThe reign of Magouyrk, however, has raised questions over Oracle's culture. Magouyrk's leadership style was cited in a pair of lawsuits filed by former VPs against the company and an executive, including an allegation that he once told an executive that his actions were \"fucking stupid\" in front of all of OCI's senior leaders. One of the former VPs who sued Oracle died by suicide in April. Oracle is seeking to force both cases into private arbitration.\n\nOracle insiders who spoke to Insider said the comments alleged in the lawsuit are generally \"tame\" compared to others Magouyrk has made. Magouryk was \"abusive to people in large group settings. It was never, 'stay after the meeting and let's have a conversation.' If he was upset, he would insult you personally and professionally,\" one former employee said. \"He'd drive grown men to tears, and then just be like, 'Jesus fucking Christ.'\"\n\nAll told, a dozen current and former Oracle employees and executives said there was what one person described as a \"culture of fear\" at OCI, telling Insider that Magouyrk is known for trying to get results by \"beating down\" employees emotionally. One employee said they were told during the interview process that they were going to want a \"fear buddy\" to turn to when they inevitably thought they were going to get fired.\n\nMagouyrk has had a meteoric rise at Oracle, promoted from an individual contributor to an executive vice president within about six years. But insiders charge that Magouyrk has failed to develop the management skills necessary to run a business of OCI's size. And since 2020, Oracle Cloud Infrastructure has lost at least a dozen vice presidents, including former senior vice president of software engineering Rahul Patil and former senior vice president Steve Daheb. Insiders believe at least some of the attrition is attributable to the culture created by Magouyrk.\n\nMagouyrk's behavior has so far been tolerated, according to insiders, because he won over Ellison and Catz by building what is arguably Oracle's single most important business, representing the core of the database giant's ongoing efforts to reposition itself as a cloud computing heavyweight, with Ellison repeatedly slamming market leader Amazon Web Services in public. Oracle's cloud ambitions came to the forefront last year when it signed a key customer deal with Zoom , and won the bid to host TikTok's infrastructure in the US (though that deal fell through).\n\n\"Larry trusts Clay because Don and Clay built OCI,\" one person said. Magouyrk is \"selling OCI as the future to Larry and Safra,\" another said. Oracle declined to comment on Magouyrk's management style or OCI's culture. Magouyrk and Johnson did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nMagouyrk joined Oracle in July 2014 as an individual contributor, having worked the previous six years as a software development engineer at Amazon.\n\nAt the time, Oracle was just entering the cloud infrastructure business, under the leadership of long-time executive Thomas Kurian \u2014 once considered a leading candidate to one day take the company over as CEO. Kurian did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nEarly on, Oracle made an acquisition Kurian hoped would help reinvigorate Oracle's lagging cloud business.\n\nBut it wasn't a good fit, two former executives said. The acquired product was designed for corporations to build a very small-scale cloud, and Oracle was trying to \"shoehorn\" it into the platform to make it work for large enterprise customers, the executives said. \"Customers hated it,\" one person said.\n\nIn the end, Ellison decided that Kurian's vision wasn't living up to expectations as an AWS rival, and tapped Magouyrk and Johnson \u2014 a former Amazon principal engineer who joined in 2014 as Oracle's senior director of engineering \u2014 to lead the charge on creating a \"second-generation\" cloud from scratch.\n\nMagouyrk, who was Johnson's first hire at Oracle, impressed Ellison early on with what he was able to accomplish with a small and nimble team. At Oracle, the production cycle for the first version of a new cloud feature could take six months; Magouyrk's team was able to cut it down to two weeks.\n\n\"Larry would say something, and Clay would say, 'We can make that happen,'\" one former senior-level employee said. \"He impressed Larry with his ability to deliver, even though the way he did it was by being incredibly aggressive and beating up on people.\"\n\nThe rise of Sparta led to infighting at Oracle\n\nThe new group was codenamed \"Draco\" and later renamed \"Sparta.\" Modeled after AWS, where Johnson and Magouyrk both previously worked, the group created a set of leadership principles modeled on Amazon's. A copy of the \"OCI values\" reviewed by Insider included principles like \"put customers first,\" \"don't be a jerk,\" and \"own without ego.\" The group filled out its ranks of so-called Spartans by poaching engineers largely from AWS.\n\nThe rise of the OCI also caused rifts within Oracle \u2014 the legacy of which can still be felt today. Kurian, who was still leading the first-generation cloud that had been internally re-dubbed \"Oracle Classic,\" started a rivalry with the new Sparta group. One person said Kurian at one point pressured Accenture to choose Oracle Classic instead of what would become OCI. Accenture did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nFinally, in the summer of 2018, Ellison issued a decree: Johnson would be given overall control of the cloud business, while Kurian would oversee the rest of Oracle's products. Kurian left in the immediate aftermath of that decision, according to two people familiar with the situation, with one describing it as a \"rage quit.\" Kurian was named CEO of Google Cloud later that year, replacing Diane Greene. Google did not comment for this story.\n\nThe decision effectively made Magouyrk the second-in-command of Oracle's cloud business, with one former employee describing Johnson as the \"mature older statesman\" who kept his outburst-prone protege in check. Once, a former employee walked out of Magouryk's office after a screaming match, according to someone who witnessed the meeting, and quit. Johnson, whose office was next door, marched into Magouyrk's office and said: \"You need to get him back or you're done,\" according to the employee. The person who quit did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nInsiders say that Magouyrk gained a reputation among some for being generally difficult to work with: In 2016, Oracle acquired the startup Dyn and integrated into a group overseen by Magouyrk. Three months after the deal closed, Dyn's leadership made it clear that it would not work with Magouyrk, with Oracle eventually reassigning it to Johnson's direct command.\n\nNonetheless, in June, Johnson told employees that he was stepping down from direct leadership of OCI to pursue new projects within Oracle, with Magouyrk tapped to replace him.\n\nNow in command of OCI, Magouyrk was able to place his own stamp on the organization \u2014 to the chagrin of at least some employees.\n\nMany of Magouyrk's alleged outbursts happened during weekly meetings, held on Fridays, sources said. The \"operations meeting\" usually has between 60 to 100 employees dialed in to go over the previous week's events. The \"critical projects\" meeting on the same day includes a smaller group of executives. During that meeting, Magouyrk reviews a packet with 50 or so pages, with each page or two representing a different leader with the status of a critical project.\n\nEach project is marked with red, yellow, or green, signifying whether the project is on track, according to a packet viewed by Insider. Completed projects appear in blue. \"Clay sometimes accuses you of being a 'watermelon,' or green on the outside and red on the inside,\" one person said.\n\nThe worst thing you can be in Magouyrk's eyes is late, people who have worked for him said. \"He says things like 'Why is the fuck is this late? Every single week you're slipping. Do you have a fucking clue what you're doing?,' one person said.\n\nAfter a big disagreement or incident, sources say Magouyrk sometimes reassigns an executive to be an individual contributor working on a low-priority \"special project.\" That executive's organization gets reassigned to another leader.\n\nThe lawsuits filed by the former VPs allege Oracle executive Tony Grayson, who reported to Magouyrk, \"actively insulted people\" and changed dates to impress his boss \"even though the team had told him these dates were unreachable, and then would tell the team they were failing when they could not meet those dates.\" As Insider previously reported, Oracle appears to have reassigned Grayson to \"focus on key data center innovation and architecture-related projects.\"\n\nMagouyrk's type of management style can be effective in some respects, but only to a point, former employees say.\n\n\"To a point, the fear culture is helpful because people really do push themselves \u2014 the internal joke at OCI is Microsoft is a country club,\" one former executive said, referring to the perception that Microsoft provides more work-life balance than other companies, but may not be as ambitious. \"But beyond that point, fear doesn't work. Fear just means people cover things up. They go watermelon.\"\n\nNotably, Johnson returned to OCI in December, starting a new cloud and artificial intelligence organization that he described in an email to employees as \"an extension of OCI, not a division of it.\" Magouyrk continues to lead OCI \"proper\" under the new structure. Oracle's internal organizational chart, viewed by Insider, shows that Johnson now oversees about one-third of OCI employees. Oracle declined to comment on the unit's structure.\n\nMagouyrk may not be what Oracle needs to win the cloud wars\n\nOCI's culture can also translate over to the unit's dealings with customers, insiders say.\n\nFor instance, OCI established a program called FairShare. A 2019 document viewed by Insider describes FairShare as a \"limit to protect customers from bursty workloads.\"\n\nBut one person with direct knowledge of the program characterized it differently, saying it is a list of customers to which Oracle had previously given big discounts in exchange for positive marketing testimonials or other services, but to whom it now regretted giving those discounts. When those customers attempt to launch new computers on Oracle's cloud, it will sometimes return an \"out of capacity error,\" and allow another customer who pays full price to use those resources, the person said. A person close to Oracle's operations disputes this characterization, though, saying that its capacity management systems ensure \"equal\" distribution of resources that doesn't favor any customers over others.\n\n\"One of the challenges for Oracle is perception and reputation,\" Futurum Research analyst Daniel Newman said. \"The company is aggressively working to overcome what can sometimes be classified as being difficult to do business with despite having more than 400,000 customers and being on a steady stream of growth in its cloud and [software-as-a-service] endeavors.\"\n\nOracle's \"first generation cloud simply missed the mark,\" Newman said. \"It wasn't competitive with the likes of AWS and Azure,\" but its second-generation cloud has been much better and yielded high-profile customer wins and \"encouraging growth.\" Newman also noted the company has yet to clearly break out on the revenue numbers for its public cloud business.\n\nInsiders say the cloud unit will need a more sophisticated, seasoned operator. Perhaps ironically, one former executive points to the success that Kurian has seen in turning around Google Cloud in the years since he left Oracle. Kurian has proven to be an effective leader and salesperson, increasing Google's appeal to larger customers and making it more competitive.\n\n\"They need a Thomas Kurian,\" one former executive said of Oracle. Without someone like that, the former executive said, Oracle's cloud ambitions could be in jeopardy.\n\n\"Something is going to go wrong enough that they are not going to be able to shove it into the closet or sweep it under the rug,\" the person said. \"They are going to run out of people to take the fall and they are going to have to hire somebody.\"\n\nDo you work at Oracle or have insight to share?

        "95": "They sit parked in megalots all across North America \u2014 next to a big stone quarry in Troy, Missouri, by an auto assembly plant in Silao, Mexico, and filling the vast parking areas outside the Kentucky Motor Speedway near Owensboro. Tens of thousands of bright, shiny, never-been-driven Ford (F) and GM (GM) trucks and SUVs.\n\nThey appear to be ride ready, but they aren\u2019t. Buyers are lined up to buy them, but they can\u2019t. The problem, as you might have guessed, is the vehicles have no chips.\n\nAnd so these cars and trucks wait in purgatory, more than $1 billion worth of them*, washed by the rain and glistening in the spring sun, a silent testament to the global chip shortage brought about by unprecedented COVID-19 conditions and some ill-advised decisions, as well.\n\nThe pandemic of course forced thousands of small businesses around the world to close. It gut punched the airline, hotel and cruise ship businesses. Commercial real estate was socked too. At the same time, the likes of Zoom, Peloton, Big Tech and the rest of the stay-at-home economy went to the moon, as they say. Those trends and outcomes \u2014 both positive and negative \u2014 were pretty readily predicted and recognized by this time last year.\n\nFew saw, however, what would happen to the semiconductor and auto industries. Before I get into what transpired and our path forward, a quick word or two about just how bad the situation is.\n\nHow bad is it Andy?\n\nSo bad that if you are shopping for a pickup and looking for a specific make or model right now, forget it. You'll be lucky if the dealer has much of anything. Billionaire Jeffrey Gundlach recently told Yahoo Finance\u2019s Julia LaRoche he wanted to buy a new truck but had to settle for a used one. \u201cAccording to Gundlach, the truck he purchased had 8,000 miles on it, but was only $2,000 less than the sticker price of a brand new truck.\u201d No deals for billionaires even. Used car prices, by the way, are soaring, up 10.0% in April and 21% over the last 12 months.\n\nHow bad is it? So bad that old-timers are scratching their heads. Usually the problem for a car dealer is too many cars and not enough customers. Now, it\u2019s the opposite. Last Saturday I spoke with a dealer in New Jersey who\u2019s been in the business for 40 years. (He wanted to remain anonymous so as not to get HQ peeved.) \"When was the last time, you\u2019ve seen a shortage of cars like this,\" I asked? \u201cNever,\u201d he told me shaking his head, \u201cnot even close.\u201d That explains why a few minutes earlier the dealer\u2019s eyes had lit up when I drove in to return my leased 2017 Escape. \u201cI can use that car,\u201d he had said hungrily.\n\nHow bad is it? So bad that GM is scrapping fuel-saving technology that requires chips on certain V8-powered Silverado and Sierra pickups. Meaning essentially that these trucks are devolving. So bad that Ford is cutting back and or halting production at eight assembly plants in North America that make Mustangs, Escapes, the popular new Bronco, oh and the F-150 pickup, the best selling vehicle in America. This of course on the heels of the rollout of its all-electric F-150, replete with a test drive by President Biden. (EVs need the same or more chips, in case you were wondering.) Ford now says the debacle will cost it some $2.5 billion in earnings this year.\n\nSo bad that workers at auto plants are being told to stay home and it\u2019s maybe even affecting the economic recovery. I spoke with U.S. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo on Thursday and asked her if that was in fact the case.\n\n\u201cIn part, yes, absolutely,\u201d she told me. \u201cIf you just take the auto industry, which is obviously a very, very important industry with a lot of jobs, but just in that one industry, we have thousands of folks furloughed right now. And that's true in other industries as well. So yes, absolutely.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s so bad that it could end up costing the U.S. auto industry $110 billion, according to AlixPartners, an industry consulting group.\n\nSo bad that Detroit has added a new phrase to the automaking lexicon, \u201cbuild-shy,\u201d which is when a carmaker builds a vehicle just shy of completion, (i.e., without the chips), to keep the factories working and jobs in place. (All those cars in those aforementioned lots are \u201cbuilt shy.\u201d)\n\nIt\u2019s so bad that President Biden has been on the case for months (to no avail) and so bad that Raimondo is working it nearly full time, meeting with auto and chip executives trying to craft a solution.\n\n\u201cThis is a real problem,\u201d Raimondo acknowledged. \u201cFord is going to be down over a million cars this year. Look at the price of used cars. Used car prices are through the roof. Why? Because this is a shortage of new cars. Why? Because they can't get their hands on enough semiconductors. So the ripple effects throughout our economy because of semiconductor shortages are extensive.\u201d\n\nSo we have auto shortages and billions of dollars of car sales lost, prices gone bananas for used cars and thousands of jobs at risk. What the hell happened? Well, COVID yes, but executives made some bad calls too. That plus over-dependence on a fragile and non-U.S.-based supply chain.\n\nBefore I get into detail there, you should know that electronics, (i.e., mostly chips) now account for some 40% of a car\u2019s cost, up from 18% in 2000. \u201cThe microprocessors and chips that power modern vehicles are now so prevalent that they're practically a commodity in the same vein as steel and aluminum,\u201d according to Car and Driver. \u201cComputers are used in everything from the mundane (such as basic trip computers) to the near magical (think road-scanning active suspensions). They've made cars quicker, safer, cleaner, more efficient, and more reliable\u2014better in every way.\u201d (There are a number of other great stats and graphics about the auto business and chips in this Deloitte report beginning on page 12.)\n\nAnd now for the tick-tock on exactly what happened to the auto industry that put them in this pickle. For an explanation here I\u2019ll turn it over to our tech writer extraordinaire, Dan Howley, from this article.\n\n\u201cRight now [automakers] are competing in the supply base with phones, and notebook computers,\u201d Willy Shih, professor of management practice in business administration at Harvard Business School, told Yahoo Finance. \u201cApple (AAPL) will sell more iPhones in the first three months of this year than all the automakers combined will sell vehicles in the whole year. So then if you're a semiconductor maker who's the more important customer?\u201d\n\nA big problem here is that most chips are made overseas, with the U.S. now accounting for only some 12% of chip capacity, a point not lost on Raimondo. \u201cSo yes, we're 12%. We want to get ourselves back up to 25% plus,\u201d she told me. \u201cWithin the 12%, if you look at what they call bleeding-edge, the most sophisticated chips, right now we're at 0%. And so that's an area where we want to really invest, so we get ourselves to a place where we can meet our demand in, say, 10 or 12 years.\u201d\n\nThat will take investment. Senator Chuck Schumer wants to allocate $52 billion towards this shortage as part of the Endless Frontier Act. I asked Raimondo if that was enough.\n\n\u201c(While] I would urge Congress to pass that as swiftly as possible, I don't think anyone thinks $50 billion is enough to solve the problem,\u201d she said. \u201cBut this is the beginning of a long term journey. And the hope would be that that $50 billion would unlock another $50 billion and $100 billion or more from the private sector, which in total would be really very meaningful in order for us to make chips in America and regain our tech leadership in the most sophisticated chips.\u201d\n\nShould the automakers change their chip inventory practices going forward, I ask? Should they hold more in reserve? Is there too much just-in-time inventory being practiced?\n\n\u201cI think that the answer is yes,\u201d Raimondo told me. \u201cI have been talking to them about that topic. I think there is broad recognition across industries, that there needs to be a reexamination of supply chain. Strategies, as you said, just-in-time, may need to be adjusted. Having said that, we don't want any hoarding of chips. There is a lot of discussion around where all the chips are going? So I think, yes, there needs to be reexamination of supply chain strategies. But also, there needs to be a lot more transparency in the supply chain, in order for suppliers to meet the demand.\u201d\n\nForget about us building up bleeding-edge chip capacity in 2030. Even just getting back to normal inventory levels will take months. Some say in the fall, some say next spring. And while we know COVID-related disruptions will abate soon enough, bigger issues, like relying on overseas partners that don\u2019t share our goals, and the decline of manufacturing in the U.S., even when it comes to the highest of high tech like chip fabrication, remain.\n\nThere\u2019s enough blame to go around when it comes to auto executives not realizing that COVID would actually create a spike in demand for autos. To be fair though that was not an obvious call.\n\nLess forgivable perhaps is squeezing every last nickel out of the supply chain, which is actually a stakeholder capitalism issue. How is that exactly? Think about it. At whose behest really is the supply chain being squeezed? For the bottom line, i.e., the shareholder. The automakers, and others, stretched supply chain lines to the limit, to please investors. Now that the supply chain is broken, who pays the price? Employees (furloughed) and customers (no trucks, no SUVs.)\n\nIf supply chains were not designed to minimize cost and instead to maximize reliability and even to prioritize domestic supply (which would boost jobs in the U.S.), this debacle wouldn\u2019t have happened or certainly not to this degree.\n\nRaimondo is right. It is a long journey. Let\u2019s hope we\u2019re setting off on it now. So do the furloughed auto workers and the buyers of all those trucks and SUVs parked in Mexico, Missouri and Kentucky, sitting idle, waiting to be started.\n\n*There are easily 25,000 cars, trucks and SUVs sitting in limbo and with the average light vehicle now costing $40,857, that gets you to $1 billion.\n\nThis article was featured in a Saturday edition of the Morning Brief on May 22, 2021.

        "96": "Several days ago I wrote about a JetBlue flight that diverted to Minneapolis due to a passenger who was snorting cocaine and acting inappropriately. This was on a New York to San Francisco flight, and the passenger was seated in JetBlue\u2019s Mint business class.\n\nThis incident came to light because a reader was on the flight, and recorded a video of the captain standing in the cabin after the plane diverted to Minneapolis, providing a mighty detailed account of events that caused the diversion.\n\nThere are now a lot more details about what happened, as a criminal complaint has been filed against 42 year old Mark Scerbo. He is being charged with one count of possession of cocaine, which carries a maximum of three years in prison and a minimum fine of $5,000. He had 24.5 grams of cocaine on him at the time of the diversion (which he claimed was creatine).\n\nI imagine he\u2019ll also face a significant fine and/or possibly jail time with the FAA\u2019s new zero-tolerance policy for poor inflight behavior, but that\u2019s not part of this complaint.\n\nThis document contains even more details of what allegedly happened on that flight, and my gosh it\u2019s wild. Here are the highlights of what\u2019s being claimed:\n\u2022 During the meal service, the passenger threw his food on the floor, grabbed a metal butter knife, and began walking up and down the aisle while holding the knife in a closed fist with the blade up\n\u2022 When the flight attendant removed the passenger\u2019s meal tray, she observed a bag containing a white powdery substance\n\u2022 The passenger sang out loud, did yoga-like movements in people\u2019s faces, and acted aggressively\n\u2022 The passenger told his seatmate that he was a prophet named Genghis Khan, accused her of being in the CIA, and said he loved her; he talked to her about nano bots, angels, and a \u201cpeace army\u201d\n\u2022 When the passenger\u2019s seatmate asked him if he was on drugs, he replied \u201cof course not, look me in the third eye\u201d\n\u2022 The passenger went to the bathroom at least six times, sometimes bringing a butter knife and a large feather; at one point he was even seen snorting the substance at his seat, and getting it all over his mustache, face, and pants\n\u2022 The seatmate was reseated because she didn\u2019t feel safe, but then the passenger walked by her and patted her on the head\n\u2022 When the passenger tried to get the attention of someone else in the cabin and was ignored, he repeatedly called him a \u201cf*ggot,\u201d and then threw playing cards at him while saying \u201csuicide kings\u201d\n\nAlso, one important point of clarification. When being questioned by authorities in Minneapolis, the man clarified that he claimed to be Toshi Nakamoto, the founder of a crypto currency, and not Genghis Khan. I\u2019m inclined to believe him on that front, because when I was reading the complaint in regards to what he was talking about to his seatmate, I thought to myself \u201cthere\u2019s no way he wasn\u2019t talking about crypto.\u201d\n\nThis isn\u2019t the guy\u2019s first drug-related run in with the law:\n\u2022 He had a prior federal conviction for conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute a controlled substance, and was sentenced to 57 months in jail\n\u2022 He was sentenced to an additional four months in jail for a supervised release violation\n\u2022 He was convicted of introducing drugs into prison, and was sentenced to an additional 18 months in jail\n\nWhat a story this is. When the flight diverted, the captain provided a play-by-play of what happened, in a way I\u2019ve never seen done before. While his description ended up being pretty accurate (even though he was on the other side of the cockpit door), I\u2019d say reality was even wilder.\n\nI feel sorry for all the other passengers on the flight, as this must have been a legitimately scary situation. I hope this guy gets the help he needs, and isn\u2019t allowed to terrorize passengers on another flight anytime soon.",
        "97": "After Oregon's catastrophic wildfire season in 2020, the state has already started preparing for the worst.\n\nPortland General Electric (PGE) did this for the first time ever last summer, cutting power to an area near Mt. Hood in response to the extreme fire danger and high winds forecasted for Labor Day.\n\nIt seemed to work. No fires broke out in that area.\n\nBut that certainly wasn't the case for other parts of Oregon. In 2020, more than a million acres burned statewide.\n\nAn incident report says downed power lines sparked at least 13 fires in the Santiam Canyon, which eventually merged with the devastating Beachie Creek Fire.\n\nFire victims sued Pacific Power, claiming the power company kept their powerlines energized despite being warned about extreme fire weather. Those lawsuits are still working their way through the court system.\n\nIn Lane County, fire victims are also suing two utility companies over last summer's Holiday Farm Fire that broke out east of Eugene. They claim tree branches sparked when they touched powerlines, and that grew into a massive fire. The official cause is still under investigation.\n\nLawsuits like these are something utility companies want to avoid in the future.\n\nIn anticipation of another potentially bad season in Oregon, the state has set some regulations around preemptive power shutoffs.\n\nAccording to temporary new rules, utility companies will have the final say on whether they will cut power, but they will have to notify the public \u2013 especially vulnerable populations that could be impacted by an outage. They also must report any fire that sparks from their equipment to the state.\n\nPlanned power shutoffs have become more frequent in California as its wildfire seasons have gotten worse in recent years.",
        "98": "For the past week, a reckoning around sexism has gripped the craft beer industry.\n\nIt began with a question, posed May 11 by Massachusetts brewer Brienne Allan on her Instagram to fellow women in the business. \u201cWhat sexist comments have you experienced?\u201d she asked.\n\nAllan received a flood of responses: more than a thousand accounts of alleged misogyny, racism and sexual misconduct from women across the country who work within the \u201cboys\u2019 club\u201d of craft brewing. The accounts quickly garnered national attention. The fallout from the accusations has already unseated several prominent industry players, from San Diego to Pennsylvania.\n\nThe reckoning has also, inevitably, reached Vermont\u2019s tight-knit craft beer scene.\n\nSeveral anonymous testimonials that Allan posted on Instagram described first- and secondhand accounts of misogynistic behavior by Shaun Hill, the founder of Hill Farmstead Brewery in Greensboro. Allan herself said that she was told that Hill had made a degrading comment about her two years ago.\n\nHill is a star in Vermont brewing. For years, Hill Farmstead has ranked among the best breweries in the nation. His establishment draws crowds of beer aficionados to rural Greensboro Bend in the Northeast Kingdom. And he\u2019s one of many high-profile men in the beer industry who are now implicated in the testimonials.\n\nVTDigger was not able to independently corroborate the allegations against Hill, and Allan has maintained that she \u201cdoes not vouch\u201d for the accuracy of individual stories she has shared, most of which she received via Instagram messages. (Allan did not return an interview request.)\n\nBut the sea of stories, Allan told Good Beer Hunting, has still proved \u201cliberating\u201d for many in the beer industry who have experienced abuse. \u201cPeople are listening,\u201d she said.\n\nInitially, Hill provided a lengthy statement to VinePair in response to the allegations. \u201cI surely have a different perspective on what has been shared both overtly and anonymously,\u201d he wrote, \u201cbut what matters is how each person sees it.\u201d\n\nStill, he continued, \u201cI have never acted in a manner that was openly, willingly or consciously dismissive, degrading or threatening.\u201d The statement, critics noted, did not include an apology or an acknowledgement of wrongdoing.\n\nReached Friday by VTDigger, Hill maintained that \u201cthese things did not happen the way that they were perceived to happen.\u201d He emphasized that most of the testimonials Allan shared were secondhand accounts \u2014 \u201ca game of telephone.\u201d As for the comment he allegedly made about her, he said, \u201cI did not say these words.\u201d\n\nUltimately, when pressed on whether he planned to apologize, Hill said, \u201cI am sorry. I am not a perfect human being.\u201d He added that he was \u201ccommitted to participating in changing the beer industry.\u201d\n\nThe accounts have rippled beyond Hill and across Vermont\u2019s craft beer scene. On Wednesday, Rochester restaurant Maple Soul, known for its beer selection, announced it would no longer sell products from breweries implicated in the allegations. Others, including the Alchemist brewery in Stowe, have put out statements in support of those coming forward.\n\nWomen in Vermont\u2019s brewing industry say the reckoning this month has brought needed attention to a longstanding problem.\n\nFor Jen Kimmich, co-founder of the Alchemist, the many testimonials Allan shared resonated with her, after nearly three decades in the beer business.\n\n\u201cSo many of the stories I\u2019ve read were so much like my own story,\u201d she said. \u201cBeing overlooked because I\u2019m a woman. Being pressured by bosses. Being disrespected. I\u2019ve experienced all of that.\u201d\n\nBut visible in the testimonials, Kimmich said, was a sense of camaraderie that was absent when she was breaking into the industry. She was \u201cabsolutely in awe\u201d reading them. \u201cThis is the first time I have felt really hopeful for young women in craft beer,\u201d Kimmich said. \u201cI am so relieved that things are shifting.\u201d\n\nNo one is surprised, though, about the content of the accusations Allan shared, which range from degrading comments to sexual assault.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re at a turning point,\u201d said Elise Pecor, general manager and partner at Vermont Pub and Brewery.\n\nPecor says she believes misogyny in brewing \u2014 while not specific to beer \u2014 is fueled by the power dynamics at play in the industry, which has turned brewers like Hill into minor celebrities.\n\n\u201cWhen you combine that inflated ego with alcohol and flat-out bad character, you get men who feel like they can get away with anything,\u201d she said. \u201cEspecially when the community is lacking diversity.\u201d\n\n\u201cI wish I could say to you that it were shocking. It\u2019s most certainly appalling. But it\u2019s not at all shocking,\u201d said Jen Huntington, co-owner of Maple Soul. The restaurant\u2019s decision not to stock products from implicated breweries, she said, was the \u201cbest thing that we could do.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been looking for a voice, we\u2019ve been looking for someone to pay attention for years,\u201d Huntington said. \u201cSo I\u2019m thrilled that this is picking up steam.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not immune here in Vermont,\u201d said Melissa Corbin, executive director of the Vermont Brewers\u2019 Association. Corbin, whose organization represents more than 60 breweries across the state, says she has heard similar accounts from women in the past.\n\nOn Friday, Corbin said, she reached out to brewery employees throughout Vermont, offering to listen to their stories. It was just the first step, she said, before further action.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s heavy,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I\u2019m so glad we\u2019re having this conversation.\u201d",

        "100": "Pope Francis, who has frequently spoken out on environmental issues, will trade in his popemobile for a new model running entirely on battery power.\n\nThe pontiff met Thursday with Henrik Fisker and Geeta Gupta-Fisker, founders of the California-based electric car startup Fisker, who provided him with renderings of the vehicle they plan to deliver during the fourth quarter of next year. It will be based on the Fisker Ocean SUV the company plans to put in production in 2022.\n\n\"I got inspired reading that Pope Francis is very considerate about the environment and the impact of climate change for future generations,\" Henrik Fisker said in a statement.\n\nThe connection to the pope, Fisker told NBC News by email, was made through \u201ca mutual friend [who] arranged the meeting.\u201d\n\nThis is the second zero-emission vehicle that the Argentine-born pope will receive. Last year, Japanese automaker Toyota delivered a specially customized version of its Mirai fuel-cell vehicle. It\u2019s currently one of three hydrogen-powered vehicles on the market. The Toyota popemobile has not seen extensive use, however, largely due to the challenges of finding a readily accessible source of the lightweight gas during the pontiff\u2019s travels.\n\nTraditionally, popes have traveled in vehicles provided to the Holy See by Mercedes-Benz, with the first presented to Pope Pius XI in 1930. Recent models have included transparent compartments where the pope can stand up while also keeping him safe. That became essential following an assassination attempt on Pope John Paul II in May 1981 in St. Peter\u2019s Square.\n\nFor his part, the current pope has maintained a low profile when it comes to the vehicles he travels in, preferring to use Fords, Jeeps and Fiats.\n\nConsidering the environmentally friendly nature of the Fisker product, and the fact that Francis met with the company founders, there\u2019s a good chance it will find more use than Toyota\u2019s popemobile once it is delivered.\n\nThe design is based on the Ocean, the first product Fisker plans to bring to market. Currently, it is set to go into production at a factory in Austria on Nov. 17.\n\nSeveral configurations will be offered to the public, including one capable of running 300 miles between charges. A base model with more limited range is expected to come in at $37,499 in the United States before applying the current $7,500 in federal tax credits.\n\nFisker founder and CEO Henrik Fisker has promised to offer an array of options for the retail model. The version earmarked for Pope Francis, however, will have at least one feature not available to the public: a unique, hand-built cupola in which he will be able to stand and wave to the public during his travels.\n\nThe bulletproof glass canopy, Fisker said, will be hidden within the SUV\u2019s roof until needed by the pope. It will then rise up with the touch of a button. He declined to offer other details, such as whether the electric popemobile will use the high-performance powertrain the company is developing for the Ocean SUV. That system will be capable of launching from 0 to 60 in around 3 seconds. But it will have a few other \u201cspecial details and features,\u201d Fisker said.\n\nWhat may prove more important while on the road will be the Ocean\u2019s quick-charge capability. The retail version will be able to get an 80 percent battery top-off in less than 30 minutes, according to the automaker.\n\nFisker told NBC News that for the green-minded pope himself, the battery drive system is only part of the appeal of the modified SUV. While some competitors likely will quibble with his claim that the Ocean is \u201cthe most sustainable vehicle in the world,\u201d it does forgo traditional luxury materials like leather in favor of alternatives derived from recycled soft-drink bottles and even plastics reclaimed from the ocean.\n\nOne of the highlights of the project was meeting with Francis, Fisker said, noting that \u201cthe Pope even signed the sketch I did of the Ocean in a Italian caf\u00e9 nearby, prior to the private meeting.\u201d\n\nThe Fisker founders probably could use a little intervention from up high. They will be launching their new company at a time when the electric car market is expected to see significant growth \u2014 but also a flood of new products from traditional manufacturers like Ford, General Motors and Volkswagen, as well as upstart brands like Tesla, Rivian, Lordstown Motors and others.\n\nHenrik Fisker was a pioneer in the field, bringing a plug-in hybrid to market a decade ago. But Fisker Automotive quickly went bankrupt, its assets sold to a Chinese company.\n\nThe Danish-born entrepreneur started out as a designer, earning a solid reputation for his work on less environmentally friendly products like the Aston Martin DB9 and the BMW Z8.",

        "110": "As more than 3.7 million Americans could start seeing enhanced unemployment benefits end next month, the Labor Department is struggling to find a way to keep unemployed workers from being cut off as the clock ticks down. An official told CBS News the federal government paying the benefits to some unemployed Americans directly is \"pretty much off the table.\"\n\nThe department is facing pressure from Democratic lawmakers and progressive groups to act as a growing number of Republican-led states have announced they will opt out of the federal program created in the wake of the pandemic.\n\nAt least 22 GOP-led states have announced this month that they will be ending enhanced unemployment benefits early. This includes the $300 a week supplemental benefits, as well as in nearly all cases the program for gig workers and self-employed individuals who do not qualify for traditional unemployment and the program for those facing long term unemployment. The state leaders claim their states have plenty of jobs and the benefits deter people from working.\n\n\"It's cruel, it's ugly, it's insidious and it's a lie,\" said Sharon Corpening, about that argument. The 60-year-old Roswell, Georgia resident was freelancing in advertising and copywriting until the pandemic hit. As such, she did not qualify for traditional unemployment, but was able to receive Pandemic Unemployment Assistance under the CARES Act, part of coronavirus relief efforts passed under President Trump that offered benefits to workers in fields not eligible for traditional benefits.\n\nWhen some state officials and business groups claim the job market is booming as the pandemic subsides, that does not mean immediate employment opportunities for her as a longtime career professional. She has been actively job hunting and networking, but she is pushing to use her expertise. And as someone with fibromyalgia, she also has health concerns.\n\n\"Them pulling the plug on this a couple months short makes a critical difference,\" Corpening said. \"They've cast this wide net, and it's devastating. Even just a few months, it means they're forcing people out of their careers.\"\n\nMany of the states announcing an end to benefits have lower vaccination rates, according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data. For 58-year-old Cindy Lang of Parma, Ohio, who is also the caretaker of her disabled parents, health is still a very real concern. When the pandemic hit, it took more than two months for the self-employed painter to receive unemployment benefits under the CARES Act.\n\n\"I'm sorry, the 400 bucks a week is like two days of my normal pay, so why would I not want to get back to work? The math doesn't add up,\" said Lang. \"It's not that we don't want to work out here. We absolutely want to work, but I'm still protecting my parents. I'm only going to start working for clients that I trust to wear masks or have been vaccinated.\"\n\nThe Labor Department also disagrees with state GOP leaders. One official called the situation \"catastrophic.\" But even if the Labor Department had the authority to provide benefits on its own, setting up the technology to do so could take months. And the department would have to obtain the unemployment data \u2014 which would need to be provided by the states now choosing to opt out.\n\nIn a letter last week to the Labor secretary, Senator Bernie Sanders said the department was \"congressionally-mandated\" to provide Pandemic Unemployment Assistance for workers ineligible for state aid and to ensure they receive such benefits, but even fot that program, while the legislative language is different, it still relies on the the states having an agreement with the secretary.\n\nHaving unemployment benefits continue may require Congress to amend the CARES Act.\n\nSome states say they will end the program as early as June 12. States are required to send the Labor Department a letter notifying them at least 30 days out of their decision to end their agreement. The Labor Department is still working out what will be included in its response to each state \u2014 pending their determination on the administration's next steps.",

The attention and volatility prompted Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell to take the very unusual step of releasing a video statement regarding the cryptocurrency market.\n\n\"To date, cryptocurrencies have not served as a convenient way to make payments, given, among other factors, their swings in value,\" Powell said in the statement.\n\nAs the shine comes off bitcoin, investors look for a safe harbor from the volatility and uncertainty and turn their attention back to gold. Many analysts have said that with bitcoin struggling, gold prices could push back to $2,000 an ounce by the end of the year.\n\nNot only is gold a traditional safe-haven asset, but it is also an important hedge against inflation.\n\nEvery day, as the global economy continues to recover, we see new evidence of the growing inflation threat. For many analysts, this is the major factor that will continue to support gold prices throughout the year.\n\nEven the mention from the Federal Reserve that the committee could soon be talking about tapering its bond-purchasing program didn't spook gold investors. The reality is even if the Federal Reserve starts tightening its ultra-accommodative monetary policies, they are still way behind the curve.\n\nIn a commentary on Kitco.com this week, Lobo Tiggre, creator of the IndependentSpeculator.com, noted that many Americans don't know what it is like to deal with inflation, but he warned them that they soon could.\n\nHe noted that inflation is \"No merely intellectual argument for me. I can still feel the shock of that overnight devaluation of the peso in the 1970s. This truth is a visceral reality for me. This is why I still save in gold and silver to this day,\" he said.\n\nAccording to some analysts, with inflation moving higher, real interest rates could hit new historic negative lows, which is the perfect environment for precious metals.\n\nIf you need further proof of rising inflation, you don't have to look very far. Friday, analysts at IHS Markit noted that input costs for both the manufacturing and the service sectors are at their highest level since 2008.\n\nMeanwhile, on the same day, the National Association of Realtors (NAR) noted that the median home price in April rose to $341,600, the highest level on record.\n\nWhile the Federal Reserve continues to see the growing inflation pressures as transitory, many analysts note that these pressures could be around a lot longer than expected.",

During the briefing, Foot Locker Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Richard \u201cDick\u201d Johnson, shared a number of figures that exceeded projections coming into 2021. Alongside news that revenue increased 82% year-over-year (to $2.15 billion) and that Foot Locker\u2019s digital business grew 43% on a comparable company analysis, a report regarding the future of remaining Footaction retail locations was shared.\n\nAcquired by the umbrella company in 2004, Footaction has historically served as Foot Locker\u2019s lifestyle-oriented counterpart. Although both shops carried mutual products, the former also stocked Nike Dunk and other Nike Sportswear classics. Over the last decade, the 45-year-old brand noticeably transitioned from a \u201cboutique\u201d experience to one that focused on performance basketball. All throughout the country, Footaction locations have been expanded to include Flight 23, a segment dedicated to the Air Jordan line and wider Brand Jordan range of products similar to Foot Locker\u2019s House of Hoops endeavor.\n\n\u201cWe are currently in the process of assessing the Footaction fleet to determine the best decision for each location,\u201d said Johnson during the call. \u201cApproximately one third of the top performance Footaction locations will be made into new Foot Locker stores establishing a bolder women\u2019s and kids presence, as well as new Champ Sports and Kids Foot Locker stores.

It looks like he's not planning on following through on that promise anytime soon.\n\nThe Washington Post reported on Friday that in Biden's upcoming budget proposal, many of the health care promises he made during his campaign, like cutting prescription drug costs, won't be included, per four people familiar with the matter. Another major promise \u2014 canceling $10,000 in student debt \u2014 also didn't make the cut.\n\nThe proposal will include more specifics than Biden's \"skinny budget\" released in April.\n\n\"The President's budget will focus on advancing the historic legislative agenda he's already put forward for this year,\" Rob Friedlander, spokesman for the White House budget office, told the Post. \"The budget won't propose other new initiatives but will put together the full picture of how these proposals would advance economic growth and shared prosperity while also putting our country on a sound fiscal course.\"\n\nInsider reported on April 7 that Biden has yet to follow through on two student-debt promises from his campaign: to cancel $10,000 in student debt per person, and to cancel student debt for undergraduates at public colleges and Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs).\n\nIn a speech on November 16, Biden said that student loans are holding borrowers up, and forgiving $10,000 in student debt \"should be done immediately.\" His campaign website also said the president would work with Democrats to \"authorize up to $10,000 in student debt relief per borrower\" as part of COVID-19 relief, but the $1.9 trillion stimulus package he signed in March didn't include that.\n\nRead more: Forgiving student loan debt is a no-brainer, and Biden could do it tomorrow if he wanted to\n\nNeither did his $4 trillion infrastructure proposal.\n\nAnd while he said he would support legislation brought to him to cancel $10,000 in student debt, Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts said in a press call last month that doing so is lengthy and expensive, and while she has legislation to do it, there's no reason Biden can't use executive action to provide the immediate relief he had promised.\n\nWarren is one of the leading lawmakers calling on Biden to cancel $50,000 in student debt per borrower through executive action, and while Biden said he doesn't believe he has that authority, he has asked the Education Department and Justice Department to review his ability to do so.\n\nSo far, Biden's Education Secretary Miguel Cardona has taken three distinct steps to confront student debt: he canceled debt for about 72,000 borrowers defrauded by for-profit schools, he canceled debt for over 41,000 borrowers with disabilities, and most recently, he expanded the scope of the payment pause to 1.14 million borrowers with private loans.\n\nBut no information has been released from the administration on additional student debt cancelation measures.\n\n\"Cancelling $50,000 in federal student loan debt will help close the racial wealth gap, benefit the 40% of borrowers who do not have a college degree, and help stimulate the economy,\" Warren and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said in a February statement.\"It's time to act.

        "118": "HORSHAM, Pa., May 21, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- The Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson announced today the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted the accelerated approval of RYBREVANTTM (amivantamab-vmjw) for the treatment of adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) exon 20 insertion mutations, as detected by an FDA-approved test, whose disease has progressed on or after platinum-based chemotherapy.1 RYBREVANTTM is the first fully-human, bispecific antibody approved for the treatment of patients with NSCLC that targets EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations, which are the third most prevalent activating EGFR mutation.1,2 Today's approval follows the FDA's decision to grant Breakthrough Therapy Designation (BTD) in March 2020 and to initiate a Priority Review of the Biologics License Application (BLA) in December 2020. This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on overall response rate and duration of response.1 Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in the confirmatory trials.1\n\n\"Today's FDA approval is an important development for people living with non-small cell lung cancer with exon 20 insertion mutations who, until now, have had no approved treatment options to target their disease,\" said Jill Feldman, co-founder of the EGFR Resisters, an advocacy organization patient group, and a lung cancer patient advocate. \"We are excited by the promise this new treatment option brings to people with this particular type of lung cancer and their families.\"\n\nLung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death among both men and women, accounting for almost 25 percent of all cancer deaths.3 Currently available targeted treatments, like EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) are generally insensitive in treating NSCLC driven by EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations and are not FDA-approved for these patients.4,5,6 In addition, NSCLC driven by this mutation carries a worse prognosis and shorter survival rates compared with lung cancer driven by more common EGFR mutations, such as exon 19 deletions and L858R substitutions.7,8 Patients newly diagnosed with metastatic NSCLC with EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations have a real-world median overall survival (OS) of 16.2 months (95 percent confidence interval [CI], 11.0 \u2013 19.4), which is lower than patients with EGFR exon 19 deletions/L858R mutations, who have a real-world median OS of 25.5 months (95 percent CI, 24.5 \u2013 27.0).9\n\n\"Lung cancer is a complex disease, and through the study and deeper understanding of genetic alterations like EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations, we are able to target the disease in new ways and improve treatment outcomes for patients,\" said Joshua K. Sabari, M.D., New York University Langone's Perlmutter Cancer Center and study investigator, who presented the latest clinical trial results at the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer's (IASLC WCLC) 2020 World Conference on Lung Cancer Singapore. \"Amivantamab-vmjw is an innovative bispecific antibody that brings an important new therapeutic approach to physicians caring for patients with this serious and rare type of lung cancer.\"\n\nRYBREVANTTM is a fully-human bispecific antibody directed against EGFR and MET receptors.1 RYBREVANTTM binds extracellularly (outside of the cell) inhibiting tumor growth and leading to tumor cell death.1 Today's accelerated FDA approval is based on positive results from the Phase 1 CHRYSALIS study, a multicenter, open-label, clinical study evaluating RYBREVANTTM as a monotherapy in patients enrolled in the prior platinum containing chemotherapy cohort.1,10 Initial results from the CHRYSALIS EGFR exon 20 insertion mutation population, which supported the BTD, were presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology 2020 Virtual Scientific Program, and updated results were presented at the IASLC WCLC 2020.\n\n\"The approval of RYBREVANT, along with the companion diagnostic test, addresses high unmet need in the treatment of people with genetically defined non-small cell lung cancer,\" said Peter Lebowitz, M.D., Ph.D., Global Therapeutic Area Head, Oncology, Janssen Research & Development, LLC. \"At Janssen, we are committed to the development of innovative therapies like RYBREVANT and believe that advancing medicines targeting specific pathways can bring the greatest benefits and improve outcomes for patients with tumor alterations such as EGFR and MET.\"\n\nThe FDA simultaneously approved Guardant Health's Guardant360\u00ae CDx liquid biopsy blood test as a companion diagnostic for use with RYBREVANTTM.\n\nNext-generation sequencing test offers an alternative to polymerase chain reaction

EGFR-mutated NSCLC, including the Phase 3 MARIPOSA (NCT04487080) trial studying RYBREVANTTM in combination with lazertinib**.12 Another Phase 3 trial, PAPILLON (NCT04538664), is studying RYBREVANTTM in combination with carboplatin-pemetrexed for people with advanced or metastatic EGFR-mutated NSCLC with exon 20 insertion mutations.13 RYBREVANTTM received U.S. FDA BTD in March 2020 and Priority Review Designation following the BLA announcement in December 2020.14,15 Janssen has filed regulatory submissions for RYBREVANTTM with health authorities in Europe and other markets.\n\n**In 2018, Janssen Biotech, Inc. entered into a license and collaboration agreement with Yuhan Corporation for the development of lazertinib.\n\nAbout the CHRYSALIS Study \n\nCHRYSALIS (NCT02609776) is a Phase 1 open-label, multicenter, first-in-human study to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics and preliminary efficacy of RYBREVANTTM as a monotherapy and in combinations including with lazertinib, a novel third-generation EGFR TKI16, in adults with advanced NSCLC.10 The study consists of two parts: RYBREVANTTM monotherapy and combination-dose escalations and RYBREVANTTM monotherapy and combination-dose expansions.10\n\nIn the ongoing Phase 1 CHRYSALIS study, patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC with EGFR Exon 20 insertion mutations weighing less than 80 kg received RYBREVANTTM 1050 mg and patients weighing at least 80 kg or more received RYBREVANTTM 1400 mg weekly for four weeks, with the initial dose as a split infusion in week 1 on day 1 and day 2, then administered every two weeks thereafter until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.1 Disease response using overall response rate (ORR), per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1* (RECIST v1.1) as evaluated by Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR), was the primary endpoint.1 In the prior-platinum chemotherapy treated cohort (n=81), the confirmed ORR, as assessed by blinded independent central review, was 40 percent (95 percent CI, 29 \u2013 51), with 3.7 percent having complete responses (CR) and 36 percent achieving partial responses (PR).1\n\nPermanent discontinuation of RYBREVANTTM due to an adverse reaction (AE) occurred in 11 percent of patients who received RYBREVANTTM.1 AEs resulting in permanent discontinuation of RYBREVANTTM in greater than or equal to one percent of patients were pneumonia, infusion-related reactions (IRR), pneumonitis/interstitial lung disease (ILD) dyspnea, pleural effusion and rash.1 Dose interruptions of RYBREVANTTM due to AEs occurred in 78 percent of patients.1 IRR requiring infusions interruptions occurred in 59 percent of patients.1 Adverse reactions requiring dose interruption in greater than or equal to five percent of patients included dyspnea, nausea, rash, vomiting, fatigue and diarrhea.1 The most common AEs (greater than or equal to 20 percent) in patients who received RYBREVANTTM were rash (84 percent), IRR (64 percent), paronychia (50 percent), musculoskeletal pain (47 percent), dyspnea (37 percent), nausea (36 percent), fatigue (33 percent), edema (27 percent), stomatitis (26 percent), cough (25 percent), constipation (23 percent) and vomiting (22 percent).1\n\n*RECIST (version 1.1) refers to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, which is a standard way to measure how well solid tumors respond to treatment and is based on whether tumors shrink, stay the same or get bigger.17\n\nAccess to RYBREVANTTM (amivantamab-vmjw)\n\nJanssen offers comprehensive access and support information and resources to assist patients in gaining access to RYBREVANTTM. Janssen will work closely with payers and providers to ensure RYBREVANTTM is broadly accessible and affordable for people with NSCLC with EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations. Our comprehensive patient support program, Janssen CarePath, helps patients get started on RYBREVANTTM and stay on track. Janssen CarePath helps verify insurance coverage for patients, provides reimbursement information, helps find financial assistance options for eligible patients and provides ongoing support to help patients start and stay on RYBREVANTTM. If patients have commercial or private health insurance and need help paying for RYBREVANT\u2122, the Janssen CarePath Savings Program may be able to help.

Among patients receiving treatment on Week 1 Day 1, 65% experienced an IRR, while the incidence of IRR was 3.4% with the Day 2 infusion, 0.4% with the Week 2 infusion, and cumulatively 1.1% with subsequent infusions. Of the reported IRRs, 97% were Grade 1-2, 2.2% were Grade 3, and 0.4% were Grade 4. The median time to onset was 1 hour (range 0.1 to 18 hours) after start of infusion. The incidence of infusion modifications due to IRR was 62% and 1.3% of patients permanently discontinued RYBREVANT\u2122 due to IRR.\n\nPremedicate with antihistamines, antipyretics, and glucocorticoids and infuse RYBREVANT\u2122 as recommended. Administer RYBREVANT\u2122 via a peripheral line on Week 1 and Week 2. Monitor patients for any signs and symptoms of infusion reactions during RYBREVANT\u2122 infusion in a setting where cardiopulmonary resuscitation medication and equipment are available. Interrupt infusion if IRR is suspected. Reduce the infusion rate or permanently discontinue RYBREVANT\u2122 based on severity.\n\nInterstitial Lung Disease/Pneumonitis1\n\nRYBREVANT\u2122 can cause interstitial lung disease (ILD)/pneumonitis. Based on the safety population, ILD/pneumonitis occurred in 3.3% of patients treated with RYBREVANT\u2122, with 0.7% of patients experiencing Grade 3 ILD/pneumonitis. Three patients (1%) discontinued RYBREVANT\u2122 due to ILD/pneumonitis.\n\nMonitor patients for new or worsening symptoms indicative of ILD/pneumonitis (e.g., dyspnea, cough, fever). Immediately withhold RYBREVANT\u2122 in patients with suspected ILD/pneumonitis and permanently discontinue if ILD/pneumonitis is confirmed.\n\nDermatologic Adverse Reactions1\n\nRYBREVANT\u2122 can cause rash (including dermatitis acneiform), pruritus and dry skin. Based on the safety population, rash occurred in 74% of patients treated with RYBREVANT\u2122, including Grade 3 rash in 3.3% of patients. The median time to onset of rash was 14 days (range: 1 to 276 days). Rash leading to dose reduction occurred in 5% of patients, and RYBREVANT\u2122 was permanently discontinued due to rash in 0.7% of patients.\n\nToxic epidermal necrolysis occurred in one patient (0.3%) treated with RYBREVANT\u2122.\n\nInstruct patients to limit sun exposure during and for 2 months after treatment with RYBREVANT\u2122. Advise patients to wear protective clothing and use broad spectrum UVA/UVB sunscreen. Alcohol free emollient cream is recommended for dry skin.\n\nIf skin reactions develop, start topical corticosteroids and topical and/or oral antibiotics. For Grade 3 reactions, add oral steroids and consider dermatologic consultation. Promptly refer patients presenting with severe rash, atypical appearance or distribution, or lack of improvement within 2 weeks to a dermatologist. Withhold, dose reduce or permanently discontinue RYBREVANT\u2122 based on severity.\n\nOcular Toxicity1\n\nRYBREVANT\u2122 can cause ocular toxicity including keratitis, dry eye symptoms, conjunctival redness, blurred vision, visual impairment, ocular itching, and uveitis. Based on the safety population, keratitis occurred in 0.7% and uveitis occurred in 0.3% of patients treated with RYBREVANT\u2122. All events were Grade 1-2. Promptly refer patients presenting with eye symptoms to an ophthalmologist. Withhold, dose reduce or permanently discontinue RYBREVANT\u2122 based on severity.\n\nEmbryo Fetal Toxicity1\n\nBased on its mechanism of action and findings from animal models, RYBREVANT\u2122 can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to the fetus. Advise female patients of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for 3 months after the final dose of RYBREVANT\u2122.\n\nAdverse Reactions1 \n\nThe most common adverse reactions (\u226520%) were rash, IRR, paronychia, musculoskeletal pain, dyspnea, nausea, fatigue, edema, stomatitis, cough, constipation, and vomiting. The most common Grade 3 or 4 laboratory abnormalities (\u22652%) were decreased lymphocytes, decreased albumin, decreased phosphate, decreased potassium, increased alkaline phosphatase, increased glucose, increased gamma-glutamyl transferase, and decreased sodium.\n\nAbout the Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson\n\nAt Janssen, we're creating a future where disease is a thing of the past.

        "123": "Families who qualify for the expanded child tax credit payments can expect to see those benefits starting July 15, but they can calculate how much to expect to receive before then. The IRS has announced that prior to sending the first batch of partial monthly payments, it will open two online portals for parents with qualifying dependents. The portals can be used to register (for those who don't normally file a tax return), to update information like a change in the number of children and to opt out of the monthly payments. We'll tell you what we know below.\n\nThe 2021 advanced child tax credit payments will go out on the 15th of the month, with each check for as much as $300 per dependent or $3,600 in total, based on the age of the child by the end of the year. Parents should be aware of the income limit and other requirements to get the full payment.\n\nWe'll be updating this story regularly to explain the separate IRS portals as we receive more details. Here are some different ways to use your child tax credit checks, how you may receive your payment and how you can claim an additional $8,000 to $16,000 credit for child care expenses.\n\nWhat will the IRS' online child tax credit portals let you do?\n\nTaxpayer families will be able to make changes to any life circumstances since they last filed their taxes, such as an income change and child custody status. For example, if you started making less money this year, you'll want to update the IRS about those changes so you can get the correct child tax credit amount.\n\nIf you had or will have a new baby this year, it's important to let the IRS know, so you can receive your payment for up to $3,600 for that child. The same applies if you adopted a child or if you gained a new child dependent since you last filed your taxes.\n\nAlso, if you've gained full custody of your child, you'll be the parent who receives the money for your kid. Note that parents who have shared custody will not each get a payment. This is important for domestic violence survivors, Nina Olson, executive director of the Center for Taxpayer Rights said during an IRS oversight hearing. \"That change of circumstances portal should allow them to enter their change in marital status and also where the children are.\"\n\nWhen will the child tax credit portals open for eligible families?\n\n\n\nThe IRS has set an open deadline of July 1, though we don't have an exact date yet. The portals could come online sooner than that. The IRS is simultaneously processing tens of millions of tax returns, which may affect the timeline while it also organizes the child tax credit program.\n\nCan the child tax credit portals be used to opt out of monthly payments?\n\nThe main portal will let you opt out of receiving the monthly child tax credit payments. What does that mean? It means that instead of receiving monthly payments of, say, $300 for your 4-year-old child, you can wait until you file your 2021 taxes next year to receive the $3,600 lump sum amount.\n\nYou may also want to opt out because you're expecting your circumstances to change and don't want to update your information in the portal.\n\nWhat about parents who don't normally file taxes?\n\nThe IRS will open a second portal dedicated to people who don't typically file their income taxes. This child tax credit portal will allow this group to give the IRS their updated information, including the number and ages of their qualifying child dependents.\n\nThe portal is expected to let tax nonfilers submit a simplified electronic form to the IRS to secure their eligibility. This group would include people who don't have bank accounts, as well as the homeless population.\n\nWhat about those who don't have a permanent address?\n\nRight now, the IRS is urging people to share information about the child tax credit to those who don't have permanent addresses. By doing this, you're helping make sure eligible people receive the payments they're eligible for. You can share the information about the portals with them so they know about the programs to help them file a tax return.\n\nWhat we still don't know about the child tax credit portals \n\n\n\nThere are still plenty of details that are still unclear about the IRS' child tax credit portals, including:\n\u2022 The exact date the portals will be available to families.\n\u2022 How the portals will work for families updating their information.\n\u2022 How families will differentiate between the two portals.\n\u2022 The process for opting out of the monthly payments.\n\nFor more child tax credit 2021 details, here's how much money you can expect to get. Also, here's what it takes for you and your dependents to qualify for the payments.",

        "125": "(Bloomberg) -- Daimler AG\u2019s truck chief expects hydrogen-powered big rigs to play an important role in slashing emissions from the transportation sector despite the technological hurdles and skepticism raised by two prominent rivals.\n\nFocusing solely on battery-electric vehicles would be risky because of the scarcity of certain raw materials and challenges grids will have supporting wide-ranging charging networks for trucks and buses, Martin Daum, Daimler Truck\u2019s chief executive officer, said in a phone interview.\n\n\u201cWe cannot afford to bank on just one technology to reach the climate goals,\u201d Daum said. \u201cThe focus until 2025 will be 100% on battery-electric vehicles. Between 2025 and 2035, we\u2019re going to need both battery-electric and fuel cell vehicles because the massively growing infrastructure requirements require a two-legged approach.\u201d\n\nFuel cells, which generate electricity from hydrogen and therefore eliminate the need to recharge batteries, have been touted for years as a potential alternative to combustion engines. But high costs and sparse fueling infrastructure have stood in the way of broader adoption and left the technology far behind battery-electric powertrains in the passenger-car market.\n\nElectrifying commercial vehicles is more complex -- they\u2019re larger, heavier and used for everything from deliveries to supermarkets in urban areas to long-haul transport in remote areas. Daimler recently formed a joint venture with rival Volvo AB to jointly develop fuel cell stacks.\n\nWhile prominent industry leaders including Tesla Inc.\u2019s Elon Musk and Volkswagen AG\u2019s Herbert Diess have repeatedly criticized fuel cells and argued battery power is the only way forward, Daimler and Volvo aren\u2019t alone in seeing long-term potential.\n\n\u201cDecarbonization of the energy mix represents the most profound shift in energy since the start of the industrial revolution,\u201d Sanford Bernstein analysts led by Neil Beveridge said in a note to clients. \u201cIt is simply impossible to reach net zero by 2050 without hydrogen playing a major role.\u201d\n\nDaimler\u2019s truck division is the world\u2019s largest maker of commercial vehicles and on track to be spun off from the Mercedes-Benz luxury-car operations this year. The split reflects the diverging technology trends between passenger cars and commercial vehicles. Both will need enormous investment in new technology to comply with stricter emissions standards.\n\nDaum, 61, mapped out more aggressive profitability targets on Thursday and objectives to generate the funds needed to navigate the industry\u2019s transformation.\n\n\u201cWe want to be a resilient company that can avoid losses even in difficult years,\u201d he said. The unit plans to list at the Frankfurt stock exchange later this year and could enter the country\u2019s blue-chip DAX Index.\n\nDaimler boasts a truly global footprint that\u2019s unique among commercial-vehicle manufacturers. While Volvo just trimmed its presence in Asia by selling its UD Trucks business in Japan, VW\u2019s Traton SE unit is finishing its takeover of U.S. truckmaker Navistar International Corp. next quarter.\n\nApart from Mercedes trucks, Daimler\u2019s trucks and buses division comprises Fuso in Japan, BharatBenz in India, Setra in Germany; and Freightliner, Thomas Built and Western Star in North America.\n\nThe company has relied heavily on profits from Freightliner in recent years, as North America tends to generate much of the industry\u2019s earnings. Executives said Thursday that boosting profitability at European operations will be a top priority and pledged to reduce personnel and material costs to become more competitive in the region.\n\nAsked whether Daimler may consider an acquisition of CNH Industrial NV\u2019s Italian business Iveco, Daum said his focus is on the company\u2019s own operations. \u201cI don\u2019t see the need for us to add an asset to our European business,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are no plans for any structural changes.\u201d\n\nMore stories like this are available on bloomberg.com\n\nSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.",

(Tasos Katopodis/Pool/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nSenators Urge Biden to Reverse \u2018Disastrous\u2019 Decision to Give COVID-19 Medical Tech and Intellectual Property to China\n\nA number of Republican senators are urging President Joe Biden\u2019s administration to reverse its \u201cdisastrous\u201d decision to give U.S. COVID-19 medical technology and intellectual property to China under a controversial \u201cTrips waiver.\u201d\n\nThe Trade-Related Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPs) waiver was first proposed by India and South Africa, and would suspend intellectual property protections for products and technologies needed for the fight against COVID-19, including vaccines, for the duration of the pandemic.\n\nOn May 5, U.S. Trade Representative Trade Katherine Tai released a statement on behalf of the administration which voiced support for the TRIPS waiver.\n\nHowever, more than a dozen Republican senators have now voiced their concerns over the controversial waiver, stating that it would do nothing to end the global pandemic and would instead \u201cfoster uncoordinated vaccine nationalism.\u201d\n\nSens. Roger Wicker (R-Miss.), Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), and Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) sent a letter to Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo and Representative Tai on May 20, asking them to reverse the Biden administration\u2019s decision to support the proposal.\n\nIn the strongly-worded letter, the senators argued that the waiver would undermine the \u201cnation\u2019s global leadership in the technologies, medicines and treatments of the future\u201d and \u201cprovide a boost to the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s \u2018vaccine diplomacy\u2019 and enable Beijing to undercut American leadership on vaccine distribution throughout the developing world.\u201d\n\nThey noted that countries such as China, India, and South Africa had \u201cfalsely claimed\u201d that the waiver would speed up the development of new vaccine capacity, and pointed to a lack of technological capacity in the supply chain as the underlying reason as to why there are not currently enough vaccine doses.\n\n\u201cVaccine production is a complex technical and logistical process, with limited technical resources (e.g., skilled scientists and technicians at companies). At best, all President Biden\u2019s giveaway to China and India and others will do is foster uncoordinated vaccine nationalism, as countries jump in to try to coerce technology transfer and manufacturing locally,\u201d the senators wrote in their letter.\n\nThe letter was signed by 13 other Republican senators.\n\n\u201cIt is not surprising that China, India, and South Africa want to steal our intellectual property and medical technology,\u201d the senators continued.\n\n\u201cWhat is surprising is that an American president, especially one who claims to be a \u2018jobs\u2019 president, would force American companies to give their medical technology and manufacturing processes to foreign adversaries like China. Simply put, the Biden Administration\u2019s support for a TRIPS waiver puts America\u2019s interests last and China\u2019s interests first.\u201d\n\nThe senators noted that they have several \u201cserious concerns\u201d over the Biden administration\u2019s support of the waiver, and demanded to know how the president had reached this conclusion.\n\nThey asked that the administration answer a string of questions by no later than June 19, 2021, including what evidence the administration relied on to conclude that intellectual property was a barrier to vaccine manufacturing and that the benefits of waiving intellectual property protections outweighed the potential costs.\n\nThe senators also want to know whether Chinese leader Xi Jinping asked the administration to grant the waiver when he spoke with Biden in March, how the waiver would be implemented, and whether private citizens would be denied their ability to protect or enforce intellectual property rights in U.S. courts.\n\nOther questions include whether or not the Biden administration plans on waiving American intellectual property laws and intellectual property enforcement, including enforcement against intellectual property and trade secret theft.\n\n\u201cUnder this scenario, what would happen if a Chinese national is found to have stolen trade secrets? Under the waiver, if adopted, would they not be prosecuted? And, what of the Chinese nationals currently being prosecuted? Would those cases now be dropped?\u201d the senators questioned.\n\nRep. Earl L. \u201cBuddy\u201d Carter (R-Ga.) also showed his support for the letter on Thursday, writing on Twitter that the controversial waiver was a \u201cgift to China.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Biden Admin\u2019s support for waiving IP protections for COVID-19 vaccines is a gift to China who has spent the past year trying to steal our IP, goes against our patent system and will stifle innovation of lifesaving drugs and cures by removing the incentives for investment,\u201d he wrote.\n\nIn his first speech to Congress in April, Biden touted U.S.-China relations, specifically intellectual property as of one his administration\u2019s key issues.\n\nThe president vowed to continue to \u201cstand up to unfair trade practices that undercut American workers and American industries, like subsidies to state-owned enterprises and the theft of American technology and intellectual property.\u201d",

Remember, the savings you carry into your senior years will need to last for several decades, and starting out with a couple of million or more is a good way to help ensure you don't run out of money in your lifetime.\n\nFurthermore, you may have the goal of becoming a millionaire before reaching your senior years. That's a reasonable objective, too.\n\nThe key, either way, is to start investing at an early age and choose your investments wisely. And guess what? You don't have to be an investing guru to check the latter box off. All you really need to do is put this one ETF in your portfolio.\n\nETFs, or exchange-traded funds, make investing really simple. The reason? You can buy shares of a single ETF and add dozens of stocks or more to your portfolio. And if your goal is to wind up a millionaire, the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF(NYSEMKT: VOO) is a good bet.\n\nThe S&P 500 indexconsists of \u2013 you guessed it \u2013 500 stocks, only they're not just any stocks. Those 500 companies are the largest ones that trade publicly, so they're a solid measure of how the stock market, on a whole, is performing. As such, an ETF that aims to match the performance of the S&P 500 is a good one to have in your portfolio.\n\nInvesting questions:How to get started in 6 steps\n\nMicrosoft, PayPal, Okta:New investors should consider these 3 great starter stocks\n\nElon Musk, Snoop Dogg and Mark Cuban love Dogecoin:Should you?

Say you invest $500 in this one ETF every month and its performance is comparable \u2013 let's call it 15%. Keep that up for 30 years, and you'll be sitting on a cool $2.6 million.\n\nEven if the S&P 500 \u2013 and the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF \u2013 only delivers an average annual 10% return during that time, you'll still be looking at just about $1 million in your portfolio from that investment alone.\n\nPlus, the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF has a very low expense ratio \u2013 just 0.03%. That's the beauty of ETFs \u2013 you won't pay high investment fees that eat away at your returns because these funds are passively managed.\n\nAn easy way to accrue millions\n\nThe Vanguard S&P 500 ETF is only one of many ETFs that track the S&P 500. And to be clear, there are other indexes you could look at if your goal is to grow long-term wealth. But the S&P 500 has a strong history of delivering solid returns, and it's a good bet if your goal is to become a millionaire without doing a lot of work to get there.\n\nThe one drawback of buying shares of the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF is that it won't help your portfolio outperform the broad market.

        "131": "Five years ago, Illinois lawmakers passed a law that boldly aimed to build a solar power industry from scratch while also saving thousands of jobs at two struggling Exelon nuclear plants.\n\nBesides bailing out the nuclear plants, the Future Energy Jobs Act promised to create tens of thousands of solar power jobs and get the state moving away from fossil fuels to a point where, by 2025, Illinois would be getting a quarter of its power from \u201cclean energy\u201d sources.\n\nThings haven\u2019t worked out as planned. The 2025 target is now far out of reach, the jobs expectations went unmet, and the solar industry is laying off workers as the funding that was promised has dried up, an investigation by Inside Climate News and the Chicago Sun-Times found.\n\nThe plans the law promised sputtered from the start.\n\nNow, state legislative leaders are racing to meet a May 31 deadline to fix its biggest problems \u2014 including the impending loss of more than $300 million in funding for renewable energy programs.\n\nWhen environmental groups, unions and consumer advocates came together to support the law, they found common ground in marrying nuclear subsidies with support for renewable energy.\n\nBut it was Exelon that emerged as the clear winner under the state\u2019s bold clean energy plan. It got $2.3 billion in subsidies funded by electricity customers over a decade for its two plants.\n\nAnd now the company is demanding even more money \u2014 and threatening to close two other nuclear plants if it doesn\u2019t get what it wants.\n\n\u201cExelon continues to get $235 million a year, while the solar support has been stripped away,\u201d said Howard Learner, executive director of the Chicago-based Environmental Law and Policy Center, who\u2019s been a critic of the state\u2019s nuclear bailout. \u201cIllinois could\u2019ve been a Midwest solar energy leader.\u201d\n\nComplicating the current scramble is the ongoing federal bribery investigation of Exelon and ComEd, its Chicago utility subsidiary. Prosecutors have said ComEd gave cash, jobs and contracts to associates of former House Speaker Michael Madigan, D-Illinois, with the aim that he would shape the legislation to the company\u2019s benefit.\n\nMadigan, who has said he\u2019s done nothing wrong, hasn\u2019t been charged with any crime, though people who were in his inner circle have been. He resigned in February.\n\nGov. J.B. Pritzker has said Exelon won\u2019t be allowed to dictate terms for fixing the state\u2019s energy law. But the company and its labor allies have immense power in the Legislature.\n\nExelon is seeking subsidies for its four Illinois nuclear plants that didn\u2019t get help under the 2016 law and threatening that its Byron and Dresden nuclear plants will close without that aid.\n\nMeanwhile, solar companies are laying off workers following the end of incentive funding tied to the 2016 law.\n\nSupporters of the law talked of a coming boom in solar jobs. But the gains have been modest. Illinois went from 3,480 solar jobs in 2015 \u2014 14th-most among all states \u2014 to 5,259 jobs in 2020, which ranked the state 13th, according to the Solar Foundation. a not-for-profit organization \u201cdedicated to advancing the use of solar and solar-compatible technologies worldwide.\u201d\n\nThough few new solar jobs came to Illinois, there has been a surge in the small-scale solar projects that the law aimed to encourage, with more than 20,000 such projects completed.\n\nBut solar remains a blip in Illinois\u2019 energy landscape. It provided less than 1% of the state\u2019s electricity generation in 2020.\n\nSolar and wind energy have grown in Illinois, but such renewable sources still account for only about 7.5% of the state\u2019s electricity consumption, far short of the pace needed to reach the 25% that was targeted by 2025.\n\nSome of the problems are specific to Illinois\u2019 political culture. But they also touch on national concerns about how to increase renewable energy while preserving the jobs and carbon-free electricity from older nuclear plants.\n\nExelon maintains, as it did in 2016, that it would shut down the nuclear plants if it considered only financial factors but that the preservation of carbon-free electricity and jobs is so important that the state should consider every option for keeping the plants open.\n\nIn a written statement in response to questions, Exelon says the 2016 law won broad support because \u201cit was, and remains, a good framework for comprehensive energy policy.\u201d\n\nLast year, Illinois got 58% of the state\u2019s electricity from Exelon\u2019s nuclear plants. The company says that closing them would leave a void that largely would end up being filled by electricity from fossil fuels.\n\nComEd spokeswoman Shannon Breymaier said the law \u201chas delivered on its goals of spurring new investment to develop renewable energy, expanding energy efficiency programs and dedicating funding to new programs that train workers for clean energy jobs and help utility customers reduce their bills.\u201d\n\nNational environmental groups including the Union of Concerned Scientists and the Natural Resources Defense Council have said they support subsidies for nuclear plants to keep them from closing prematurely.\n\nAs their support suggests, much of the criticism of the Illinois law isn\u2019t about the nuclear subsidies but, instead, the taint from the bribery scandal and concerns that the renewable-energy provisions were severely underfunded.\n\nIn 2016, Exelon was threatening to close its Clinton and Quad Cities power plants and wanted Illinois lawmakers to require utilities, including ComEd, to charge consumers for a 10-year subsidy for the plants.\n\nAt the time, environmental groups, clean energy business groups and environmental justice advocates had their own proposals.\n\nMadigan, who won\u2019t comment now, made clear that any clean energy proposals needed to go through Exelon.\n\n\u201cBeing able to pass clean energy legislation was conditioned by the speaker to reach agreement with ComEd and Exelon and labor,\u201d said Jen Walling, executive director of the Illinois Environmental Council, which led the push for renewable energy provisions.\n\nWalling, whose group represents more than 90 environmental and community groups in Illinois, said Madigan\u2019s stance forced environmental advocates to work with Exelon.\n\nFormer Gov. Pat Quinn, a Democrat who held that office from 2009 until he lost a 2014 re-election to Republican Bruce Rauner, said the process was unseemly but typical for Exelon.\n\nExelon wanted \u201cthe renewable people to literally crawl to them,\u201d Quinn said. \u201cAs long as they could hold up the renewables and the progressive stuff, they\u2019d get more for themselves.\u201d\n\nFederal prosecutors have said ComEd\u2019s actions at that time were an element in a pay-to-play environment for energy legislation in Illinois, with ComEd giving cash, contracts and jobs to people connected to Madigan. The investigation has led to indictments and a deferred-prosecution agreement for ComEd.\n\nBreymaier said ComEd has \u201csubstantially strengthened oversight and controls of its lobbying and hiring,\u201d among other steps to prevent actions like those described by prosecutors.\n\nThe legislative debate included talk of social benefits on a grand scale.\n\n\u201cWe are going to create tens of thousands of jobs around the state of Illinois, in communities of color but also for our brothers and sisters downstate and the rural economy,\u201d then-state Rep. Christian Mitchell, D-Chicago, said of the promise of the solar program.\n\nMitchell, who\u2019s now Pritzker\u2019s point person on energy and the environment, didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.\n\nOther than the nuclear bailout, the 2016 legislation had provisions requiring utilities to increase the amount of in-state renewable energy they buy, with funding of about $225 million a year.\n\nThe law included requirements to encourage energy conservation, with each utility having to expand energy-efficiency programs and meet certain goals through 2030.\n\nUtilities also got some big benefits that were not widely known, including the ability to expand a loosely defined \u201csmart grid\u201d modernization program that began in 2011 and allowed utility companies to raise rates \u2014 and increase profits.\n\nThe grid modernization has led to $4.7 billion in added costs for ComEd customers since 2012, with little evidence the money led to substantial benefits for consumers, according to a report in December from the consumer group Illinois PIRG.\n\n\u201cAny interests of ComEd or Exelon are not left up to chance,\u201d said Abe Scarr, the organization\u2019s director and co-author of the report. \u201cThey are guaranteed.\u201d\n\nBreymaier said the spending tied to the grid modernization has been vetted by regulators and improved the reliability of ComEd\u2019s system while maintaining unusually low electric rates compared to those found in other big metropolitan areas.\n\nOn Dec. 7, 2016, then-Gov. Rauner signed the landmark energy bill into law.\n\nHe did that at a high school in Port Byron, a small town near the Quad Cities nuclear plant that would get subsidies.\n\n\u201cWhile this legislation isn\u2019t perfect, it allows us to protect jobs, ratepayers and taxpayers,\u201d Rauner said.\n\nExelon had only a short wait to start getting paid. It began receiving the bailout money in early 2018.\n\nBut state officials spent nearly two years drafting and implementing procedures for the clean energy provisions of the bill. That took time because the state was setting up a process for how to decide which companies would get the limited funding. And the office in charge, the Illinois Power Agency, had fewer than 10 employees.\n\n\u201cThese are complicated programs,\u201d said Anthony Star, the agency\u2019s director, who said the small staff wasn\u2019t an issue. \u201cYou can\u2019t just turn them on overnight.\u201d\n\nOne of the centerpieces of the clean energy provisions was what was called an \u201cadjustable block program,\u201d designed to dramatically increase customer-owned solar power.\n\nSolar entrepreneurs saw this as an attractive deal, especially for community solar projects, providing a nearly guaranteed profit for developers and discounted electricity for consumers.\n\nThe first round of applications in 2018 turned into a feeding frenzy, with projects far outnumbering the available funding.\n\nAs developers vied for the limited dollars, a much bigger flaw emerged with the way lawmakers had set up the funding. Money for the renewable energy programs came from a charge on customer bills of about $1.15 per month for households, more for businesses. The charges provided for funding that turned out to be far short of what was needed to get on track to reach 25% renewable electricity by 2025.\n\nCustomers began to pay the charges in mid-2017. The money accumulated for about two years while the Illinois Power Agency was designing the programs and selecting the first projects. After those began to get money, many developers were slowed by delays related to the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nThe state agency was making decisions based on the idea it could spend all of the available funding. But the projects were coming online so slowly that there was going to be a large unspent balance as of May 31, 2021 \u2014 the date the law set for when any balance would be returned to customers as a refund.\n\nAs of late 2020, the agency had committed all of the projected available money and had none to give to projects on the long waitlist for funding.\n\nAnd the agency was facing the loss of the ability to use some of the money utilities already collected, but not paid, to other projects because the unspent balance was set to go back to utility customers. As of March, the projected balance of unpaid money was $352 million.\n\nIllinois now is facing the consequences of what went wrong with the 2016 law.

But I do think that the markets will learn. Elon is not going to have this influence forever.\"\n\nMusk has turned the spotlight on dogecoin after hinting that the meme-inspired cryptocurrency could be used to make payments towards Tesla. On Thursday, he tweeted \"how much is that Doge in the window?\" along with an image of what appeared to look like a one-dollar bill with the meme-famous Shiba Inu dog.\n\n\"The fact that he is a 100-plus billionaire, and he runs Tesla and SpaceX and all these things doesn't change the fact that ultimately he's a human - and humans get excited about dog coins. That's just a thing that humans get excited about,\" Buterin told CNN. \"I don't think that Elon has a kind of malevolent intent in any of this.\"\n\nRead More: 7 crypto heavyweights told us what's behind the sudden sell-off that erased over $400 billion from the market in just 24 hours - and whether now is the time to 'buy the dip'\n\nThe crypto market plummeted this week after Tesla halted bitcoin payments. Bitcoin fell as much as $30,000, while Ethereum's ether and dogecoin lost more than 30% each.\n\nEther's decline to around $2,708 per coin means Buterin may have lost his status as the youngest crypto billionaire for now. His Ether address, which he disclosed on Twitter in 2018, showed a balance of about $888 million as of Friday, down from around $1.1 billion on Wednesday.\n\nBut he isn't fazed by the dramatic sell-off, and even acknowledged the market could be in a bubble. According to the entrepreneur, it's \"notoriously hard to predict\" when bubbles could burst. \"It could have ended already,\" he said. \"It could end months from now.\"\n\nOn bitcoin's energy concerns, Buterin said resource consumption is huge. \"It's not the sort of thing that's going to break the world by itself, but it's definitely a significant downside.\"\n\nHe thinks the crypto community will call for a transition to a less energy-intensive technology, or expects bitcoin to get left behind if it sticks to the way it's currently produced.",

Cordish was proposing to build a casino on 17 acres of Bow Tie Partners-owned land at 1301 N. Arthur Ashe Blvd.\n\nFour other casino operators submitted proposals to build in Richmond in February, and in the following months the city gradually cut the field down to Urban One and Cordish.\n\nKnown for its dozens of radio stations, including four in Richmond, Urban One teamed up with Peninsula Pacific Entertainment on its bid for a casino. Peninsula Pacific owns and operates Colonial Downs Racetrack and five Rosie\u2019s Gaming Emporium locations in Virginia, along with a pair of casinos in New York and Iowa.\n\nUrban One got a taste for the casino business in 2016, when it invested $40 million for a minority stake in MGM National Harbor, a resort casino in Maryland.\n\nIn a prepared statement released Thursday, Urban One CEO Alfred Liggins thanked the city and lauded the tax revenues Urban One estimates the project would generate.\n\n\u201cWe are fully committed to creating good paying jobs with profit-sharing for employees, pathways to successful careers, and generating significant new tax revenues that can improve Richmond\u2019s schools and fund community programs and infrastructure,\u201d Liggins said.\n\nIn addition to a 100,000-square-foot gaming floor and 250-room hotel, Urban One\u2019s project would also include a 3,000-seat theater, a 20,000-square-foot event space, 55 acres of green space with a festival lawn, and 12 restaurants. Liggins has previously said they\u2019re in talks with some local restaurateurs to open concepts at the development.\n\nUrban One claims the project would generate $525 million in tax revenue over the next decade, and that they would pay the city a $140 million up-front payment. Per its website, Urban One estimates that 77 percent of the casino\u2019s visitors would be non-locals.\n\nStoney, who said the project would be \u201can additional economic engine in South Richmond,\u201d is now preparing to introduce the casino matter to the Richmond City Council at its May 24 meeting.\n\nIf approved, it would head to the Virginia Lottery Board, which regulates casinos in the state, before the city petitions Richmond Circuit Court for the referendum to be placed on the ballot in November.\n\nZed Smith, The Cordish Cos.\u2019 COO, issued a statement expressing their disappointment in losing out on the deal.\n\n\u201cWhile we believe our site clearly would have brought the largest long-term economic benefit to the City and its residents, as evidenced by the City\u2019s own independent, outside consultant, we respect the Evaluation Committee\u2019s decision,\u201d Smith said.\n\nPhilip Morris owns the land on which Urban One is planning the project.

        "138": "Investors have digested the idea that inflation is currently running above previous expectations. Now, the focus shifts to the Federal Reserve\u2014and how quickly it will respond to the rise in prices.\n\nThere have been plenty of reasons for concern. Measures of inflation in the prices consumers pay have consistently exceeded forecasts in the past several weeks. A year ago, prices were knocked lower by the pandemic, so they are rising rapidly as life in the U.S. returns to normal. Trillions of dollars in government aid is creating demand, while problems in the supply chain are raising costs for companies, forcing them to raise prices.\n\nThe S&P 500 is essentially flat since mid April, a stretch that included a 4% pullback. Prices in the bond market indicate investors expect inflation over the next five years to come in at an annual rate of 2.62%, up from less than 2% at the start of the year. Still, the expected rate is down from more than 2.7% on May 10. \u201cThat inflation shock fear eased over the past week,\u201d wrote Dennis DeBusschere, head of portfolio strategy research at Evercore. Now, investors are watching the Fed to see how quickly it will respond to the inflation. The Fed\u2019s first move would likely be to reduce the amount in bonds it has been buying as part of its effort to keep interest rates low, and the economy running well, during the pandemic. Less money moving into the market would reduce bond prices and raise their yields, increasing the cost of borrowing for home buyers and corporations alike. Higher yields also erode the current value of future cash flows, bringing stock valuations lower. The minutes from the Fed\u2019s April 28-29 policy meeting, published last week, even raised the possibility that members may begin discussing scaling back, or tapering, the asset-purchasing program at coming meetings. \u201cIn investors\u2019 eyes, the taper signal timeline was pulled forward to July instead of August,\u201d DeBusschere says. And while tapering would be the first move, the second might be to raise the benchmark lending rate, an action that could come sooner than expected. The futures market for the federal-funds rate is now reflecting a rate just under 0.25%, up from 0.2% a few weeks ago, according to Evercore data. The Fed\u2019s current target range for the rate is between 0% and 0.25%. The point is that investors are now expecting interest rates across the board to rise sooner rather than later. Don\u2019t be surprised to see significant stock-market volatility as the Fed story unfolds.",
        "139": "The Covid-19 resurgence in some parts of Asia could lead to a change in fortunes for China, according to an economist. Previously, the U.S.-China trade war caused companies to move their supply chains out of China, shifting their production and distribution networks for products and services. As a result, countries like Vietnam and India benefited as companies moved to set up shop in their countries. But the situation appears to be changing, and supply chains could pivot back to China as cases spike in India and Vietnam, according to Zhang Zhiwei, chief economist at Pinpoint Asset Management.\n\n\"Before the pandemic, we saw factories moving out of China \u2014 Samsung, Foxconn these big name companies \u2014 setting up factories in Vietnam, India,\" he told CNBC's \"Street Signs Asia\" on Monday. The spike in cases in those two countries has forced factories owned by Taiwanese contract manufacturer Foxconn, a major Apple supplier, to shut down facilities in India and Vietnam, he said. \"This could put the relocation of supply chains on hold for quite some time. The key issue here is that international travel is suspended, so multinational companies can't send their staff to India and Vietnam to set up new factories,\" Zhang added. Cases in India surged to record-breaking highs in April and shows little signs of abating significantly \u2014economists have predicted the South Asian economy will likely contract this quarter.\n\nIn Vietnam, the northern province of Bac Giang on Tuesday ordered four industrial parks \u2014 including three that house production facilities of Taiwan's Foxconn \u2014 to temporarily shut down due to an outbreak of Covid-19. The situation could benefit China, Zhang suggested. However, he pointed out that the extent of how much China could stand to gain will depend on how long the situation in India and Vietnam continues for. Right now, export growth in China is between 20% to 40% a month, he said. If the factories in India and Vietnam return to production very soon, China's exports would be expected to slow down in the second half of the year as companies move their manufacturing to those two countries. \"But if supply chain (in India and Vietnam) is disrupted for a long time, we could see this kind of 20%, 30% export growth (in China) to continue into next year,\" Zhang said.",

A report Tesla is testing a technology recently panned by CEO Elon Musk seems to be the biggest news item. But investor reaction to that technology\u2019s adoption would not necessarily send shares higher.\n\nTesla (ticker: TSLA) stock closed up 4.4% Monday to $606.44. The S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average, for comparison, gained 1% and 0.5%, respectively. The Tesla gain snapped a trend of three consecutive losing Mondays.\n\nSo what sent shares soaring?\n\nWells Fargo initiated coverage of the company Monday. But analyst Colin Langan \u2018s rating was Hold and his price target $590 a share. A Hold rating isn\u2019t a bullish call on any stock.\n\nLangan wrote deliveries would continue to surprise, but he had three concerns related to competition, rising costs, and autonomous vehicles that kept him on the sidelines. He doesn\u2019t see the stock doing much of anything for the next few months.\n\nBloomberg reported that Tesla was testing lidar sensors from Luminar Technologies (LAZR). Lidar is short for laser-based radar. It is part of most auto makers\u2019 plans for self-driving vehicles. Lidar sensors can see in different conditions than radar, optical cameras, and sonar. What\u2019s more, they can help build a 3-D image of the world cars need to operate without human intervention.\n\nMusk, however, has eschewed lidar technology. Tesla is trying to achieve full autonomous driving with optical cameras. And Musk famously said he wouldn\u2019t use lidar sensors if they were free on Tesla\u2019s third-quarter conference call in October 2020.\n\nAdopting lidar isn\u2019t necessarily a good thing for Tesla stock. Adoption calls into question the company\u2019s optical-only strategy. It also raises the possibility that Tesla\u2019s autonomous driving features, called Autopilot and Full Self Driving, are progressing at a slower than expected rate. On the other hand, Tesla might simply be monitoring the state of the art.\n\nLuminar and Tesla didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.\n\nLuminar shares traded higher early in the day when the report was published, but closed down 1%.\n\nThe best reason Tesla stock is up might just be the fact that it has been down. Shares have fallen for five consecutive weeks.\n\nA few issues have weighed on the Tesla stock. The company\u2019s trading of Bitcoin, followed by its decisions to accept, then not accept, Bitcoin as payment for vehicles has created a distraction for investors. Tesla also dealt with some confusion over a Texas crash, which was thought to involve Tesla\u2019s driver-assistance features until crash investigations by the government preliminarily concluded that the features were most likely not turned on. Tesla has also faced delays in building its new German assembly plant.\n\nWhatever the reasons, there has been a lot for Tesla investors to think about. Shares are down about 14% this year after rising 743% in 2020.",
        "141": "(CNN Business) A weeks-long blockbuster antitrust trial between Apple and Epic Games culminated on Monday with the maker of the hit video game Fortnite calling Apple an \"overlord\" and the iPhone maker suggesting Epic is paving the way for a \"scary\" future for iOS customers.\n\nAfter spending days presenting reams of dueling economic analysis and documentary evidence, the two sides landed on Monday where they began: arguing over how Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers should interpret Apple's role in a sprawling digital economy. The outcome of that analysis could reshape how digital app stores work or uphold Apple's prime position in its app ecosystem.\n\nIn a matter of weeks, Gonzalez Rogers is set to decide whether Apple is an agile innovator that reaped just rewards for building a popular app business, or if it is, as Epic alleges, a monopolist that uses its control over the iOS App Store to illegally harm competition, restrict innovation and keep prices high.\n\nWrapping up the three-week trial, which saw top executives including Apple CEO Tim Cook and Epic CEO Tim Sweeney called in for questioning, the judge said Monday she will strive to issue an opinion by mid-August, though it could take longer given the thousands of pages generated by the groundbreaking antitrust case.\n\nEpic has arguedApple's walled-garden ecosystem makes it impossible to download iPhone and iPad apps from anywhere but Apple's own app store, making Apple a monopoly owner. That allegedmonopoly creates opportunities for Apple to impose restrictive terms on iOS app makers, Epic claims, such as requiring a 30% cut of all in-app sales of digital goods and services. (Fortnite was kicked out of Apple's App Store last summer for flouting Apple's rules on digital payments by directing players to its own, outside system.)\n\nOn Monday, Epic pleaded with Gonzalez Rogers for an order banning Apple from implementing some of its policies and forcing Apple to allow third-party app stores to compete with its own proprietary app store. Epic also accused Apple of trying to convince the judge it is a \"benevolent overlord\" of the iOS ecosystem that should be allowed to continue to operate without competition \"because it's worked out okay so far.\"\n\n\"That is not a defense under the antitrust laws,\" Epic's lawyer said. (When Gonzalez Rogers pointed out that Apple couldn't be \"benevolent\" while also being anti-competitive, Epic's lawyer disagreed and said Apple was only \"pretending to be a benevolent overlord\" and needed to be genuinely tested against competitors.)\n\nBy contrast, Apple has urged Gonzalez Rogers to consider the company's App Store as part of a vibrant, competitive market for video game sales. A procession of prominent executives, culminating with Cook on Friday, argued that Apple's platform rules protect users and provide security and privacy. And on Monday, its lawyers said that giving Epic what it wants would be unjustified and unprecedented.\n\nGonzalez Rogers offered critical questions to both sides. She challenged Apple on its commission structure, pointing out that \"if there was real competition, that number would move and it hasn't.\" Apple argued later that it has reduced commissions several times, such as by creating a discount for small businesses.\n\nAt certain points, the judge implied she was open to finding that Apple had broken the law, musing hypothetically about potential restrictions she could impose on Apple under California law, or considering an analysis that could allow for a finding of anticompetitive conduct by Apple without deciding that it holds a monopoly.\n\nShe also pushed hard against Epic on Monday, suggesting that what the company was asking her to do was to \"change the business model\" of Apple. She challenged Epic's lawyer, Gary Bornstein, to cite an example of a case that had ended in that type of outcome involving private litigants. The attorneys briefly debated the landmark Microsoft antitrust case of the 1990s, the US government's recent case against Qualcomm and a pending Supreme Court case before ultimately rejecting them as appropriate comparisons.\n\n\"You haven't told me a single antitrust case where the kind of relief you are requesting has been granted by a court when a private plaintiff comes in,\" she said. \"It is a pretty significant step that courts haven't done.\" (Bornstein admitted he did not have a perfect analogy on hand and that the judge faces \"a pretty unique situation.\")\n\nBy expressing reservations about precedent, Gonzalez Rogers opened the door to arguments by Apple that giving into Epic's requests would represent a serious break from history.\n\n\"If that is scary for Apple's iOS customers ... and for this court, that is simply a consequence of what Epic is asking for,\" said Apple's lawyer, Richard Doren. In contrast, Epic claimed that Apple is attempting to \"scare the court.\"\n\nBut at other times, Gonzalez Rogers appeared to relish her role on the cutting edge of the law.\n\n\"They don't call us the Wild West for nothing,\" she joked.",

Here are a few of those reasons:\n\nA flood of initial public offerings can put pressure on the broader stock market because money managers need to sell other holdings to take part in the deal, Cramer explained. Right now, there appears to be a slowdown in IPOs after a surge to start this year, he said, which is a positive. Relatedly, Cramer said the end of the frenzy involving new special purpose acquisition companies, or SPACs, benefits the entire market. \"They will not be missed and if they try to come back again, they will be shunned,\" he said.\n\n\"Thanks to multiple stimulus packages, people didn't have to sell their holdings in order to pay their bills. In a normal recession, many investors are forced to liquidate their stocks. This time, we have totally avoided that,\" Cramer said.\n\nA few companies have yet to report, but for the most part, the latest round of earnings has wrapped up. That's good news, Cramer said, because share repurchases are likely to pick up pace, which can lead to higher equity prices.\n\nAccording to Cramer, the remaining factors contributing to diminished selling pressure in the market: less concern about a hike in capital gains taxes, potential stabilization in cryptocurrencies, and a lack of alternative investments outside of stocks.",

        "147": "Wednesday will see Nvidia (NVDA) step up to the earnings plate, when the chip giant will release its April quarter\u2019s (F1Q) financials. Ahead of the anticipated print, Oppenheimer\u2019s Rick Schafer has made a list of what to look out for.\n\nLed by gaming, Schafer sees \u201cbroad upside vs. original $5.3B outlook,\u201d and thinks results will be better than the Street\u2019s forecast of $5.4 billion in sales and EPS of $3.28, while guidance for the July quarter should also improve on the $5.5 billion/$3.28, revenue and EPS estimates, respectively.\n\n\u201cSupply tightness,\u201d however, will put a cap on the upside, and Schaffer also believes that until the end of the year, \u201cconstraints likely persist, though gradual supply improvement supports continued Q/Q growth.\u201d\n\nLooking at the company\u2019s main revenue sources, Schafer expects the Gaming division to grow by more than 100% year-over-year, compared to the 67% year-over-year uptick in F4Q, \u201cled by robust GeForce RTX demand, which continues to outstrip supply.\u201d\n\nAlthough the company has aggressively pushed to boost supply, channel inventories \u201cremain lean,\u201d and the analyst notes that Nvidia remains the leader in high-performance PC gaming where \u201ccontent/performance/console are driving outsized demand.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, the crypto boom and its impact on GPU sales alone will drive an extra $100 million of upside \u2013 sales are expected to come in now at $150 million vs. $50 million originally.\n\nThe other main breadwinner, Data Center, is expected to build on the A100\u2019s momentum, and with the addition of Mellanox should increase by 85% year-over-year.\n\n\u201cWe see hyperscaler spending accelerating into 2Q/2H and up 15% for CY21,\u201d the 5-star analyst said. \u201cNVDA share gains, particularly in AI inference, lead above-market growth.\u201d\n\nElsewhere, while Nvidia\u2019s Automotive segment showed a 1% drop in F4Q, Schafer estimates 6% growth in the quarter. The analyst has high hopes for the segment and calls it the \u201cnext major growth pillar.\u201d\n\nInflection is anticipated by 2023/2024, and by 2027, the company expects the segment to generate revenue of $8 billion. The analyst also believes last year\u2019s revenue sharing subscription deal with Mercedes will lead to similar deals with other auto OEMs.\n\nAll in all, Schaffer rates NVDA an Outperform (i.e. Buy) along with a $700 price target. The implication for investors? Upside of 12%. (To watch Schafer\u2019s track record, click here)\n\nIt\u2019s safe to say Nvidia remains a Wall Street favorite. Based on 22 Buys vs. 2 Holds, the stock boasts a Strong Buy consensus rating. Given the average price target stands at $685.43, the shares are anticipated to appreciate ~10% over the coming months.

        "148": "Lordstown Motors slashes production forecast for its electric pickup And it already needs more cash\n\nLordstown Motors\u2019 cash-rich SPAC dreams have turned out to be nothin\u2019 more than wishes. The automaker reported Monday a disappointing first-quarter earnings that was a pile-up of red-ink-stained negativity.\n\nLowlights include higher-than-expected forecasted expenses, a need to raise more capital and lower-than-anticipated production of its Endurance vehicle this year \u2014 from around 2,200 vehicles to just 1,000. In short, the company is set to consume more cash than the street expected and is further from mass production of its first vehicle than promised.\n\nThe value of the company, which went public via a SPAC last year, has fallen sharply from its post-combination highs. Today its shares are off another 7% after the close of trading, thanks to its Q1 2021 report.\n\nInvestors were not thrilled with the company that 11 months ago showed off a prototype of Endurance, the all-electric pickup truck that it has bet its future on.\n\nLordstown Motors is an offshoot of CEO Steve Burns\u2019 other company, Workhorse Group, a battery and electric transportation technology company that is also a publicly traded company. Workhorse is a small company that was founded in 1998 and has struggled financially at various points. Its offshoot, Lordstown Motors, has previously said it planned 20,000 electric trucks annually, starting in the second half of 2021, at the former GM Assembly Plant in Lordstown, Ohio. Lordstown Motors acquired in November the 6.2 million-square-foot factory from GM.\n\nLordstown reported a $125 million net loss on zero revenue, along with capital expenditures of $53 million in the first quarter. And yet, Lordstown had little to show for its outsized spending.\n\nThe company said in a release that it would still begin production of its Endurance electric pickup truck this year but that its output \u201cwould be at best 50% of our prior expectations.\u201d That fact on top of its massive cash drawdown was hardly investor catnip.\n\n\u201cOur research indicates a very robust demand for our vehicles,\u201d Burns told investors during a call Monday. \u201cHowever, capital may limit our ability to make as many vehicles as we would like, and as such, we are constantly evaluating our capital needs and the various types of capital available to us, including strategic capital.\u201d\n\nThe EV company anticipates ending 2021 with just $50 million to $75 million in liquidity, despite its recent SPAC combination that helped capitalize its operations. Lordstown finished 2020 with $630 million in cash; it wrapped Q1 2021 with $587 million. The company anticipates \u201ccapital expenditures of between $250 [million] and $275 million,\u201d in addition to its regular cash consumption from operating costs.\n\nBurns said the company was in discussions with an unnamed financial entity for asset-backed financing.\n\n\u201cWe have zero debt and we have a lot of assets, and we\u2019re buying a lot of parts. So there\u2019s folks that want to finance that,\u201d he said. Lordstown is also still pursuing an Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing loan from the U.S. Department of Energy. Executives said DOE has done several rounds of due diligence but declined to comment on the timing, though Burns said multiple times that Tesla wouldn\u2019t exist had it not gotten an ATVM loan in January 2010.\n\nFor post-combination SPAC companies, Lordstown\u2019s lackluster results and bearish trading are yet more indication that the boom in using blank-check agreements to take EV and other automotive-focused companies public was perhaps premature.\n\nLordstown announced its SPAC merger in September 2020 with a market value of $1.6 billion. Its shares soared to $31.80 apiece at their 52-week highs. Today they are worth $8.77.\n\nBurns lauded the company\u2019s purported competitive advantages, including its hub motor architecture and physical simplicity, which he said would translate into a lower cost of ownership. But the company has stiff competition from new EV entrants Rivian and Tesla (should the Cybertruck ever hit production) and legacy automakers like Ford, which debuted the electric model of its nameplate F-150 truck model earlier this month with a price point under $40,000.\n\nBut Burns reiterated his feeling that the company was on par with its competitors and that it wants to be \u201cready to pounce\u201d in response to vehicle demand. The CEO also said he was confident that the truck would hit the 250-mile target range, though this is less than both the Rivian R1T and the Ford F-150 Lightning.\n\nLordstown also gave a brief update on preorders following its announcement in January that it hit a milestone of 100,000 preorders. Burns said around 30,000 of those had been converted to what it\u2019s calling \u201cvehicle purchase agreements,\u201d but he demurred on exactly how many of those customers have paid anything, saying only that \u201cmany of those\u201d agreements, included some kind of down payment.\n\nThe company also began work on its second vehicle, an electric van, with a prototype anticipated later this summer.\n\nTurning to Lordstown\u2019s first quarter performance, we\u2019re observing a pre-revenue company in the weeds of testing and scaling production for an incredibly complex product. Which is an expensive endeavor.\n\nThe company\u2019s greater-than-before sales and administrative costs are whatever compared to its spiraling research and development spend. For investors holding onto Lordstown shares in hopes of its eventual early construction runs leading to mass production that is now further in the future, it\u2019s a tough income statement to digest.\n\nIn the first quarter of 2021 the company spent around $91,000 in research and development expenses. \u201cThe higher than expected R&D spend is largely from higher part costs from a supply chain that remains under duress, from collocations, and which impacted our beta costs, higher costs of shipping included expedited shipping and greater use of temporary external engineering,\u201d Lordstown CFO Julio Rodriguez said.\n\nCompany executives also briefly addressed accusations by short seller Hindenburg Research, who claimed the automaker was faking preorders of its vehicles. Hindenburg said that \u201cextensive research reveals that the company\u2019s orders appear largely fictitious and used as a prop to raise capital and confer legitimacy.\u201d\n\nBurns told investors that the company established a special independent committee to investigate the allegations in the report. This is in addition to a separate investigation from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which the company is cooperating with, he said.\n\nIn the wake of Lordstown\u2019s results, however, shares of Tesla and Nikola were largely flat.",

That amounts to approximately 1,000 miles of free driving.\n\n\u201cRecently, we partnered with Electrify America to support owners of the Kona Electric and our IONIQ plug-in sedans. Electrify America\u2019s plan to have a network of over 800 stations by the end of 2021 offers owners the access they need to fully enjoy their EV,\u201d said Jos\u00e9 Mu\u00f1oz, president and CEO of Hyundai Motor America. \u201cIn order to support our IONIQ 5 customers, we will continue to partner with Electrify America to provide convenient, ultra-fast charging stations across the country.\u201d\n\nThe two years of free charging for Ioniq 5 customers begins on the date of purchase and is valid on both vehicle purchases and leases.\n\nOne of the best features of the Ioniq 5 is its amazing fast charging capability.

However, the Ioniq 5 charges so quickly that we doubt you'd need to stay any longer. If you find yourself in a position where to absolutely need to charge to 100%, you could always unplug after 30 minutes and then plug back in and start a new 30-minute free session.\n\nThe Ioniq 5 is really shaping up to be one of the most exciting EVs to hit the market in 2021, which is a year that full of other new EV introductions.

        "155": "Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) has now opened a new 15-gate addition to the Tom Bradley International Terminal (TBIT). The West Gates at the Midfield Satellite Concourse will serve airlines flying to domestic and international destinations and is part of the airport\u2019s modernization program.\n\nThe new West Gates are open\n\nLAX celebrated the official opening of the new West Gates. The $1.73 billion expansion includes 15 gates with a modernized terminal experience. The airport advertises the extensive use of natural light in the new gates and will come with passenger-friendly features like expanded seating areas, power outlets, and WiFi.\n\nMayor Eric Garcetti stated the following on the opening of the new West Gates:\n\nSpeaking at the launch event, Mayor Garcetti characterized the new gates as being part of the catalyst for bringing people back to Los Angeles:\n\n\u201cThis is the newest and best facility we have. So, for folks who wonder, this is smoother, better, newer, shinier, you can smell that new car smell still here, and together with LA Tourism, we\u2019re investing in bringing people back. If you\u2019re vaccinated anywhere in the world come to LA. So, you can come back not quarantine. People who are vaccinated can come back and people who\u2019ve never visited before this is the time to come to LA.\u201d\n\nAbout the new gates\n\nThe building was designed to complement the TBIT. The new gates feature to emulate a swell in the ocean, as an homage to Los Angeles\u2019s position as a coastal gateway.\n\nThere are \u201cneighborhoods\u201d within the building that include several aircraft gates, a restroom core, and retail concession spaces. This branches off of the central \u201cdowntown\u201d area, which is recognizable from its high ceilings, elevator towers, and its location in the main core of the building. The interior finishes and colors were carefully selected to reflect the urban fabric of Los Angeles.\n\nThe 15 gates can cater to a variety of aircraft. Depending on the size of the aircraft, the West Gates can serve 12 to 15 aircraft at once. Two gates can serve the larger Airbus A380 or Boeing 747-8s. The remaining gates can handle other widebodies like the Boeing 777, 787, or Airbus A330. In addition, the gates are easily able to accommodate aircraft like the Airbus A320 family.\n\nTo access the gates, passengers can use the underground pedestrian tunnel from the TBIT. The tunnel originates near Gate 148. There are also airfield buses that will transport passengers to the new gates.\n\nTechnology is a big part of the new gates. The airport has embraced the use of biometrics, which involves having customers looking into a camera, being matched with their data, and boarding the flight. A biometric pilot test at the airport boarded an Airbus A380 in 20 minutes.\n\nThere are also electronic gates. There, passengers can scan their boarding pass or passport and be cleared to board a flight. This can also help speed up the boarding process.\n\nMore lounges are coming to the airport. The West Gates feature nearly 60,000 square feet available for lounges. In spring 2022, Air France plans to unveil a new lounge at the airport. This will be accessible to its La Premi\u00e8re, Business, and Flying Blue Elite Plus customers.\n\nIn addition, there are plans to create a common-use lounge. In these spaces, passengers can purchase daily access. More details will come on the lounges.\n\nWhat the new gates mean\n\nSeveral airlines have already started operating from the gate. This includes ultra-low-cost carrier Frontier Airlines. However, Frontier plans to exit the airport this fall.\n\nAllegiant Air is also now operating out of the West Gates at Los Angeles. The airline uses the airport as a base and has four Airbus A320s located at the airport. The airline is targeting more opportunities to grow. It currently serves 33 cities in 21 states from Los Angeles, with new services planned.\n\nAllegiant\u2019s passengers will check-in at Terminal 1 and be bussed out to the new gates. While not the best option for passengers, the airline is more than happy to have more room to grow from these gates than its previous home at LAX.\n\nIn general, the airport is primed for growth. Los Angeles is emerging as a top leisure destination. The city is also a gateway to local businesses and the entertainment industry will allow the airport to keep its status as a premier Californian and American airport. Already, airlines are coming back to the airport as travel starts to recover.\n\nLike most other established airports, LAX is in the midst of a massive modernization program. The total program is expected to cost around $14.5 billion, allowing the airport to grow more efficiently and have room to cater to new airlines.\n\nWhat do you make about the new West Gates at TBIT?

        "156": "As people think about traveling again, Airbnb has released a major revamp of its website and app. At the center of the redesign is a focus on flexibility. Building on a feature the company started rolling out in February, the next time you look for a place to stay, you don't have to specify an exact set of dates. Instead, you can tell Airbnb you want accommodation where you can get away for a weekend, a one-week vacation or an entire month.\n\nIn the spirit of that same flexibility, the app will display homes that fall just outside your search parameters to highlight some of the platform's best properties. And if all you want is to find an interesting place to stay, you can use the Flexible Destinations feature to surface listings like treehouses, boats and cabins. Elsewhere, Airbnb has tweaked the checkout process to make it faster. It has done some work to make cancellation policies more straightforward and reviews more helpful.\n\nFor hosts, Airbnb has redesigned the onboarding process to make it faster to add a property. What used to involve dozens of different steps, the company has now distilled to 10. As you add photos to your listing, the app will automatically arrange them based on \"guest appeal.\" It will also offer text suggestions to help you with writing titles and descriptions. And if you live in the US, Airbnb can automatically pull from publicly available real estate information to fill in details like the number of bedrooms and bathrooms in your space.\n\nAirbnb's new features will appeal most to people who want to get away and aren't particular about the destination.

From the strong reception it has received so far \u2014 generating nearly 45,000 reservations in less than two days \u2014 it would seem that Americans are finally plugging in to the electric market.\n\nHowever, it is likely to take time for \"heartland\" motorists to embrace electrification, said Kristin Dziczek, lead analyst with the Center for Automotive Research.\n\nTim Esterdahl, a longtime pickup owner in Nebraska, said the technology \"isn't quite there yet.\"\n\n\"My problem with a truck like Lightning is the trade-off you have to make in rural areas where there's no real infrastructure,\" said Esterdahl, who frequently posts about trucks on YouTube. The more weight loaded into the bed or the bigger the trailer you're towing, the more the range drops.\n\nEsterdahl said that while he likes electrification and owns a Ford F-150 PowerBoost, a conventional hybrid version of the truck, taking the Lightning to \"the family's favorite camping site\" would probably mean detours and hours of charging. That's not going to work with a young family onboard, he said.\n\nOther pickup fans who use their F-150s for work have said the Lightning's 6-foot bed makes the truck unsuitable for some tasks, because plywood, which comes in 8-foot sheets, would protrude from the tailgate.\n\nHowever, the flood of new electric models is broadening the appeal of the technology for some motorists.\n\n\"Consumers are catching on,\" Dziczek said, and \"for a variety of reasons.\"\n\nFor one thing, \"the market is getting crowded,\" Dziczek said, with new EV sedans, SUVs and sports cars offering real choice. Ford's Lightning is the third battery pickup revealed so far, following the Tesla Cybertruck and the GMC Hummer \u2014 with as many as eight more to follow.\n\nPrices are starting to dip. One reason for the Lightning's initial success is that it will start at $39,974 \u2014 just $16 less than Tesla's Model Y SUV.\n\nBiden's infrastructure bill includes $174 billion to promote electric vehicles, with a large chunk dedicated to sales incentives. But it also envisions a national grid of 500,000 high-speed chargers, making it easy to travel anywhere without range anxiety.\n\nEven if that falls through, companies like ChargePoint and EVgo are rapidly expanding their networks, and New York last week announced a plan to back a major network of chargers across the state.\n\n\"Expanding high-speed charging in local markets across the state is a crucial step in encouraging more drivers to choose EVs,\" New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said the day Biden visited Detroit.\n\nElectric vehicles account for just 3 percent of new vehicle sales in the U.S., but that's triple the number it was three years ago.\n\n\"So far we have 35 reservations\" for the F-150 Lightning, \"which is about two months' worth of our traditional F-150 volume,\" said Bruce Collins, sales manager of Suburban Ford in Ferndale, Michigan. \"That number is about double what we expected,\" he said, adding that the customers are a mix of traditional pickup buyers and \"those coming from a different market segment.\"\n\nIt is widely expected that electric vehicles will reach at least a 30 percent share by decade's end.\n\n\"I expect it will be hard to sell anything that isn't electric\" by then, said Seth Weintraub, a longtime EV owner who is editor of the online magazine Electrek.\n\nNot everyone is convinced. Honda and Toyota expect that there could be more demand for hybrids well into the future. Neither has launched a long-range electric vehicle in the U.S.; Toyota will unveil its first next week in an event at its headquarters near Dallas.\n\nIn a few parts of the country, notably California, EV sales are already pushing toward double-digit numbers. But the surge is barely visible in other parts of the country.",

LVMH is the parent behind a number of globally known names in luxury, including Louis Vuitton, Dior, Celine, Mo\u00ebt, Hennessy, and now Tiffany.

        "166": "After Tesla made an OTA (over-the-air) update in 2019 to cap the cell voltage of Model S and Model X battery packs, we have been following the stories related to that. The first lawsuit that we heard about came from David Rasmussen. The Chinese government also said it would investigate that, but the first legal implication came from Norway, where Tesla was convicted to pay compensation to its customers. However, there\u2019s a lot more to this story.\n\nStarting from the beginning, the voltage cap this Norwegian lawsuit attacked seems to be related to a spontaneous Model S fire that happened in Shanghai in April 2019. Soon after that, in June, Tesla released the updates 2019.16.1 or 2019.16.2, which capped the voltage of cells. By doing that, Tesla also restricted the range and the charging speed of these cars.\n\nThe first suspicion about that came from Cato Standal, a Norwegian Tesla customer with a Model S P85. He had his battery pack replaced for another one, and the new one had charging and range restrictions. Later, David Rasmussen reported the same issues in the US and went further ahead, suing Tesla for them. His lawyer, Edward Chen, accuses Tesla of concealing battery pack fire risks by reducing the vehicle\u2019s capacity to accept charging.\n\nIn Norway, more than 30 owners sued Tesla in a conciliatory board for the issue with their battery pack, apparently with the help of Bilklager. This company organizes consumer consortiums to tackle legal problems as a group. That makes it more affordable to sue automakers. A conciliatory board is also referred to as a \u201csemi-court,\u201d and it works similarly to small claims courts. This is the first element that makes this situation unique.\n\nWe are not sure why these more than 30 owners and Bilklager decided to sue Tesla on a conciliatory board. Our guess is that it could be faster. We learned that they are a compulsory jurisdiction before some claims can be made before district courts. This could also be a reason. Curiously, Tesla did not file a response to the lawsuit and was convicted in a default judgment. It is not clear if this was a strategy or something else, which is the second element that makes this decision pretty unique.\n\nRegardless, Tesla was condemned to pay 136,000 Norwegian kroner to each of these owners on May 17. It has up to May 31 to pay the compensation or to appeal the case until June 17 to the Oslo Conciliation Board. Even Sandvold Roland \u2013 Norway's Tesla PR head and one of Tesla's last professionals in that department \u2013 refused to comment on the decision.\n\nThe 136,000 kroner are equivalent to $16,271 at the current exchange rate. Norway has 10,000 other affected customers with cars made from 2013 up to 2015, but it is not clear if the decision includes them or if all of them would have to seek the same compensation in similar lawsuits.\n\nThere\u2019s a similar lawsuit against Tesla in Denmark, according to , with 75 customers apparently demanding the same measures. Meanwhile, US courts and the five Chinese departments that were going to investigate this issue are yet to decide anything.\n\nWe\u2019re trying to understand the entire story both in Norway and in Denmark and to talk to some of the involved customers. If you are familiar with the lawsuit and with the Norwegian legal system, you are more than welcome to give us your takes and help us get a complete picture of the situation.",

        "171": "Bitcoin is still in a stretch of double-digit intraday moves after briefly halving its value last week, and Wall Street strategists say this crazy run won't be over anytime soon. It's been a rude awakening for bitcoin investors who thought they could handle the crypto volatility. The world's largest digital currency suffered a 30% one-day drop last Wednesday, falling to about $30,000 apiece. Just in mid-April, bitcoin hit a record high of $64,829. The turbulence was dramatic even by crypto's standards. The last time bitcoin saw a decline of this magnitude was March 2020 at the height of the Covid pandemic. And even then, the trading wasn't as jarring. Bitcoin has experienced 14 down days in May alone, according to Coin Metrics. So far this year, there have been 39 days with daily swings of 5% or more in either direction, based on bitcoin's closing prices. There were 42 such days in all of 2020.\n\nWhile the digital token bounced back rapidly with the price up 20% above $39,000 on Monday, heightened regulatory pressure as well as its technical picture are pointing to more wild trading ahead, strategists said. \"The drubbing that cryptocurrencies have received over the past two weeks is just a taste of things to come,\" Peter Berezin, chief global strategist at BCA Research, said in a note. \"Crypto markets will continue to face tighter regulation. ... In the near term, the pain in crypto markets could drag down other speculative assets such as tech stocks.\"\n\nThe recent fluctuations came amid elevated regulatory scrutiny in the U.S. and abroad. The U.S. Federal Reserve will soon release a paper outlining its own research into the central bank digital currency area. Meanwhile, Chinese authorities have vowed to crack down on mining and trading of the cryptocurrency. Elon Musk, a proponent of cryptocurrency, also did a sort of 180 on bitcoin when he announced the electric car maker had suspended vehicle purchases using the asset, citing environmental concerns over the so-called computational mining process. \"Bitcoin remains comically volatile,\" said Adam Crisafulli, founder of Vital Knowledge. \"The economic utility of nothing shifts this rapidly.\" Bitcoin's 31.1% intraday decline was the fourth-largest drop on record for the cryptocurrency, according to data from Cornerstone Macro.\n\nLooking at bitcoin futures positioning, analysts at JPMorgan believe the worst of the correction is not in the rearview mirror yet. Momentum traders have pared back their bitcoin futures bets after its failure to break above $60,000 turned sentiment bearish and induced further position unwinds, according to the Wall Street firm. \"Despite the recovery in prices to around $40k, the momentum signals, and in particular the longer lookback period one, remain problematic as a signal,\" Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, a managing director at JPMorgan, said in a note. \"It is too early to call the end of the recent bitcoin downtrend.\" Carter Worth, chief market technician at Cornerstone Macro, said there are interested sellers waiting at the $42,000 level and this heavy overhead supply will make it hard for bitcoin to go up and breach that level. Meanwhile, buyers who picked up at its recent lows will sell if the price moves up too much, he said. \"It sold off to its trend line,\" Worth said. \"Every move it's made has been technical in nature.\"\n\nRetest of last week's lows possible",

        "175": "As the economy continues to improve after a coronavirus-plagued 2020, the risk of home foreclosure for American families is lessening. In fact, the , a mortgage technology and data provider, shows that could hit pre-pandemic levels by the end of 2021.\n\nMany feared a repeat of the 2008 economic recession after the COVID-19 pandemic hit, as stay-at-home orders were put into place, businesses closed and layoffs became common. The U.S. government issued a \u2013 a period of time during which homeowners don\u2019t have to make mortgage payments due to economic hardship \u2013 for all loans backed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which own the rights on about half of all U.S. mortgages. Following that example, many private mortgage servicing companies also put their own forbearance programs in place.\n\nHomeowners struggling to make monthly payments can also refinance their home loan in today\u2019s ultra-low interest rate environment, saving hundreds per month and thousands over the life of the loan. If you're interested in refinancing your home loan, you can explore your mortgage refinance options by visiting Credible to compare rates and lenders.\n\nCONSIDERING A MORTGAGE REFINANCE? THIS IS WHERE TO START\n\nWhat to do if you can\u2019t make your mortgage payments\n\nA ruling from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) for the remainder of 2021. As strong U.S. economic recovery continues, many experts expect foreclosures to rise heading into next year, but not at alarming levels. That\u2019s because homeowners have several options this year that they didn\u2019t have during the 2008 recession.\n\u2022 Refinancing: One popular option over the past year has been to take advantage of historically low interest rates and refinance your mortgage. Homeowners who refinance could potentially save hundreds on their monthly payments. Many homeowners refinanced over the last year, but even as interest rates increase, Black Knight estimates another 14.5 million homeowners could still benefit from refinancing their home loan. If you\u2019re thinking of refinancing, to view loan options across multiple lenders.\n\u2022 Sell your home: One of the greatest arguments against a foreclosure surge is . Unlike the 2008 recession, home prices are much higher and most homeowners do not owe more on their home than what it\u2019s worth. If homeowners can no longer keep up with their monthly payments, selling their home could be a good alternative and potentially profitable option.\n\u2022 Talk to your servicer: Homeowners and mortgage servicers both lose when a home is forced into foreclosure, so instead of forgoing your payment, call your mortgage servicer \u2013 many will have options and will work with homeowners on alternative options.\n\nFORECLOSURE IN YOUR FUTURE? HERE ARE 4 WAYS TO SAVE YOUR HOME FROM THAT FATE\n\nWhat to expect on the foreclosure front post-pandemic\n\nMortgage delinquencies \u2013 or mortgages that are 30 days or more past due, including those in forbearance \u2013 dropped 7.11% in April to 4.66%, marking the first time delinquencies fell below 5% for the first time since the pandemic began. This means about 400,000 homeowners became current on their mortgages in April.\n\nBut this still leaves about 1.8 million homeowners in serious delinquency, or 90 days or more past due on their mortgage but still not in foreclosure, according to the Black Knight report. And the vast majority of those are in forbearance. As those federally regulated forbearance periods draw to an end this year, the third and fourth quarter will show a better picture of what's to come.\n\nFor those struggling with mortgage costs, refinancing could be a good option to lower your payment. You can use an to determine new monthly costs.\n\nFEDERAL FUNDS RATE ABOUT TO RISE: WHEN AND HOW MORTGAGES, OTHER LOANS WILL BE IMPACTED\n\nAs 2021 reaches its midway point, more homeowners continue to exit their forbearance periods. As homeowners start to make their payments once again, they have several options available to them if their incomes took a hit during the pandemic or if they are struggling to start making payments again.\n\nVisit Credible to get in touch with experienced loan officers and get your mortgage questions answered.\n\nHave a finance-related question, but don't know who to ask?

(Comcast-owned NBCUniversal is the parent company of CNBC.)\n\n\"My comment to Brian was that this is the pickle out of the jar,\" Malone said in an interview with CNBC's David Faber. \"If the regulatory environment permitted, down the road, all kinds of relationships could be contemplated between this enterprise that we're creating and Brian's enterprise. I think there are many opportunities for this Discovery-[WarnerMedia] enterprise to work with NBCUniversal to develop successful businesses.\"\n\nTelecom giant AT&T announced May 17 a deal to combine its content unit WarnerMedia with Discovery. Under the agreement, AT&T will unwind its $85 billion acquisition of the then-named Time Warner, which closed just under three years ago, and form a new media company with Discovery. The deal will create a new business, separate from AT&T.\n\nMalone said \"there's no question\" Roberts wanted to acquire WarnerMedia, but AT&T felt a transaction with Comcast would have been problematic from a regulatory perspective and complicated with regard to ownership structure. It's unclear if Roberts would have been willing to give up control of NBCUniversal in a deal \u2014 a move Malone made with Discovery.\n\n\"At this point in time, assessing the regulatory environment, the competitive environment and people's requirements for control, I believe AT&T made the judgment they were better off at this point in history working with Discovery than other potential spinoff partners,\" Malone said. \"I'm sure NBCU was very much in their minds as an alternative.\"\n\nDiscovery CEO David Zaslav, who is expected to take over as the combined company's CEO, told CNBC last week he believes Warner-Discovery can one day reach 400 million global streaming subscribers.

That could lead to another transaction \u2014 potentially with NBCUniversal \u2014 to combine content and gain international scale.\n\nRoberts and former NBCUniversal CEO Steve Burke held preliminary conversations more than three years ago on a joint streaming service that would have combined WarnerMedia's content with NBCUniversal's, according to people familiar with the matter.

The major convictions within a span of two days underscore how the Justice Department is cracking down on fraud cases from COVID-19 relief.\n\nIn May alone, federal prosecutors brought charges in separate in New Jersey, one in , a separate case, one in and one in . In these cases, defendants are still presumed innocent.\n\nAlso in early May, an man pleaded guilty to false statements to a financial institution in attempting to get a $300,000 PPP loan.\n\nThe Justice Department has charged more than with fraud related to PPP loans. Some cases are substantial. For example, in March, a pleaded guilty to a scheme applying for 15 different PPP loans using 11 different companies to get $24.8 million. In a pending case in California, federal prosecutors charged eight defendants with seeking more than 100 loans totaling almost using stolen identities and fake companies.\n\nBut the very first PPP fraud case closed last week.\n\nFORMER GEORGIA MAYORAL CANDIDATE USED $323G PPP LOAN ON SWIMMING POOL, FURNITURE, DOJ SAYS\n\nStaveley, 54, of Andover, Mass., to conspiring with David Andrew Butziger, 53, of Warwick, R.I., to file fraudulent PPP loan applications at a Rhode Island bank, according to the U.S. Attorney\u2019s office for the District of Rhode Island.

He then left a suicide note in his car, which was located by the ocean in Massachusetts, unlocked and with his wallet inside, according to the Justice Department.\n\nAfter staging his suicide, Staveley traveled to various states and used false identities and stolen license plates from May 26 until the U.S. Marshals Service captured him on July 23 in Alpharetta, Ga., according to prosecutors.\n\nThe Small Business Administration\u2019s Paycheck Protection Program was part of the first COVID-19 relief measure, known as the CARES Act, for Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security. The program allowed qualifying businesses to receive forgivable or low-interest loans to meet payroll costs and was intended to reduce job losses during an economic emergency. In March 2020, Congress and then-President Trump made $349 billion in forgivable loans available to small businesses in the CARES Act.

Since then, the coronavirus pandemic has provided an impetus to rebuild the collaboration, and the companies have looked to standardise parts and platforms to cut costs.\n\nNissan has already been sharing common platforms, powertrains and components with Renault and Mitsubishi, but those efforts have \"reached the maximum we should do,\" Ashwani Gupta, Nissan's COO, told Reuters in an interview on Friday.\n\n\"That's why we are shifting the gear of further synergies using electrification as the main pillar,\" he said.\n\nThe focus will be on sharing batteries, electric powertrains and electronic architecture, he said, adding that adopting a uniform standard across the alliance would \"contribute significantly\" to economies of scale.\n\nGupta said electrification would not pose a supply challenge because of Nissan's global sourcing of components. He said it had battery sourcing in China, Japan, Europe and the United States.\n\nTogether the alliance sold more than 7.8 million cars last year, down about 23% from 2019 as the companies were hit by the pandemic.\n\nThe push to share more of the work on electric vehicles (EVs) illustrates the scope of the challenge facing automakers everywhere, as the industry is being transformed by fast-moving technology.\n\nFord (F.N) has a strategic alliance with Volkswagen AG (VOWG_p.DE), under which Ford will use its German partner's MEB electric vehicle platform to build some models.\n\nToyota Motor Corp (7203.T) has expanded ties with companies including Subaru Corp (7270.T) and Chinese battery and automaker BYD (002594.SZ) to jointly develop EVs, while Honda Motor Co (7267.T) and General Motors (GM.N) will introduce two jointly developed large-sized EV models using GM's Ultium batteries in 2024.\n\nNissan, one of the world's first car makers to embrace fully EVs with its Leaf model, will share the platform of its upcoming all-electric Ariya SUV with Renault.\n\nBatteries are one of the costliest components of EVs, with raw materials accounting for the largest part of the cost. Yet battery development has been one of the weaker points of the more than 20-year alliance, with both Nissan and Renault sourcing batteries separately. read more\n\nRenault Chief Executive Luca de Meo said this month the two companies are in talks to collaborate more by using the same battery technology, and Gupta said on Friday they have agreed on the common specifications of batteries.\n\nGupta also said that while keeping the distinctiveness of each brand was important in the alliance, the automakers would share \"to eliminate the duplication of resources\".\n\nNissan, Japan's number three automaker by sales, has said it will electrify all new models in key markets by the early 2030s.

Experts predict that over time, the vaccine's efficacy will wane, causing you to need a booster shot at some point down the line. While you should feel confident you're protected for the time being, health experts are already offering their best guess as to when you'll need to sit down for another shot. And according to Moderna CEO St\u00e9phane Bancel, you might need a booster sooner than you think.\n\nRELATED: If You Got Pfizer, This Is When You'll Need a Booster, CEO Says.\n\nAxios reached out to Bancel via email to get his take on when those who got the Moderna vaccine would need a third shot. On May 19, the CEO predicted an eight- to nine-month gap between your original Moderna vaccination and a booster shot. \"People at highest risks (elderly, healthcare workers) were vaccinated in December/January,\" Bancel said. \"So I would do [a] September start for those at highest risk.\"\n\nSaying that he didn't want to take any chances, Bancel added, \"I think as a country we should rather be two months too early than two months too late with outbreaks in several places.\"\n\nDuring an Axios live event on May 19, the timing of booster shots was on everyone's mind. Multiple experts weighed in on when they thought the time would come for another shot, including Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla. Bourla also believes that those who were vaccinated earliest could be up for a third dose as early as September. \"The data that I see coming, they are supporting the notion that likely there will be a need for a booster somewhere between eight and 12 months,\" he said.\n\nWhite House COVID adviser Anthony Fauci, MD, agrees that a booster shot in the near future is likely. \"I think we will almost certainly require a booster sometime within a year or so after getting the primary [shot] because the durability of protection against coronaviruses is generally not lifelong,\" Fauci told Axios.

Kansas City Southern shareholders retain 12.6% of the combined company, whereas they would have retained 25% under terms of the original agreement.\n\u2022 Both offers include the assumption of around $3.8 billion in debt.\n\u2022 Kansas City Southern has already paid a $700 million termination fee to Canadian Pacific, which is expected to be reimbursed by Canadian National, per an SEC filing.\n\nNot so fast: Canadian Pacific opted against raising its bid, but not because it's given up. Instead, the spurned suitor is biding its time, believing that the new deal will be blocked by U.S. regulators.\n\u2022 Its optimism is rooted in a decision last week by the U.S. Surface Transportation Board (STB) to deny Canadian National's request to form a voting trust that would buy and operate Kansas City Southern while the deal is under regulatory review.\n\u2022 Canadian Pacific had been successful in its own voting trust motion, and believes the STB reticence on the current deal is because of some route overlap and competition issues that aren't present in the original merger. That said, STB is taking a second look at Canadian National's offer, now that Kansas City Southern has actually accepted it.\n\nThe bottom line: If STB does stop the Canadian National train, Canadian Pacific remains positioned to pick up the route.",

But then Tesla burst onto the scene with the Model S and it changed everything, and it\u2019s actually still going strong, almost 10 years after its launch.\n\nRecently, performed a range test in a variant of Model S that is no longer available, the Model S Long Range Plus. It has a 103.9 kWh battery pack (measured by the EPA, as there is no official capacity figure provided by Tesla) and its EPA range is 390 miles (627 km) on the combined cycle, but you can\u2019t actually achieve it if you exclusively drive it on the highway, at highway speeds.\n\nThis is what did with the Long Range Plus Model S - they drove it at 75 mph constantly on 100-mile highway loop and they got a very impressive 320 miles (515 km) out of it at that speed (the source points out that a Model S 100D achieved 270 miles in the exact same test). And in reaching this result, it has about as much range as many internal combustion-engined vehicles (albeit not the longest range ones, like some diesels you can still buy in Europe).\n\nNowadays there are many EVs whose range is similar to an ICE vehicle\u2019s, but where some EVs fall short is when you drive them at relatively high speeds constantly. If driven like this, they will fall short of the claimed range by quite a margin. And the Model S Long Range Plus tested by also didn\u2019t hit its 390-mile EPA claim, but its result is still remarkable for an EV driven constantly at speed.\n\nKeep in mind that this Tesla\u2019s battery pack still has 18650 lithium-ion cells and that upcoming models will be equipped with the newer and better performing 4680 cells. The Model S Plaid and Plaid+ are said to feature these improved battery cells, although they\u2019re still at least a year away from mass production.

Both of these retailers will be reporting results for their fiscal quarters ending in May, which we and other data aggregators count as part of the June-quarter reporting tally.\n\nThe other 13 S&P 500 members reporting results this week, which includes bellwethers like NVIDIA, Salesforce.com, Dollar General and others will be reporting results for their fiscal quarters ending in April, which form part of the March-quarter reporting tally.\n\nWe all know that the overall earnings picture is very strong, with broad-based growth momentum across all major sectors and the overall earnings tally reaching a new all-time quarterly record in Q1.\n\nThe year-over-year growth numbers were very strong in Q1, partly reflecting the easy comparisons to the year-earlier period. The easy comparisons issue will be even more pronounced in Q2 as the corresponding 2020 period represented the pandemic's severest impact.\n\nWe should keep in mind, however, that the strong earnings growth we saw in Q1 and the even stronger growth expected in Q2 is also reflective of genuine growth in the absolute sense, not just a result of easy comparisons.\n\nThese are quarterly earnings totals, with aggregate earnings estimates for 2021 Q2, and actually reported earnings for 2020 Q2 and 2019 Q2 highlighted.\n\nYou can see that 2021 Q2 earnings for the S&P 500 index are expected to be up +58.4% from the Covid-hit 2020 Q2 period. But even relative to the pre-Covid 2019 Q2 period, 2021 Q2 earnings are expected to be up +7.3%.\n\nEstimates have been steadily going up, as we have been consistently pointing out in our earnings commentary, though the favorable revisions trend has eased off in recent weeks.\n\n2021 earnings and revenues are expected to be up +33.2% and +9.9%, respectively, which follows the Covid-driven decline of -13.1% in 2020.\n\nOn an index 'EPS' basis, the 2021 expectation works out to $181.02, up from $135.98 per 'Index share' in 2020.\n\nRecap of Q1 Earnings Season Scorecard (As of Friday, May 21st)\n\nWe now have Q1 results from 477 S&P 500 members or 95.4% of the index's total membership. Total earnings (or aggregate net income) for these 477 companies are up +48.4% from the same period last year on +10.1% higher revenues, with 86% beating EPS and 77.4% beating revenue estimates.\n\nAs noted earlier, we have 13 index members on deck to report Q1 results this week.\n\nThe two sets of comparison charts below put the Q1 results from these 477 index members in a historical context, which should give us a sense how the Q1 earnings season is tracking at this stage relative to other recent periods.\n\nOn an ex-Finance basis, the Q1 earnings growth for the remaining companies that have reported results drops to +37.2%. But even on an ex-Finance basis, the Q1 earnings growth rate still compares favorably to other recent periods.\n\nFor a detailed look at the overall earnings picture, including expectations for the coming periods, please check out our weekly Earnings Trends report >>>>Strong Retail Sector Earnings\n\nFrom thousands of stocks, 5 Zacks experts each have chosen their favorite to skyrocket +100% or more in months to come.

        "197": "Bank of America Corp.\u2019s Merrill Lynch Wealth Management unit is banning trainee brokers from making cold calls, a vestige of an era when the industry pushed hot stocks on anyone who would pick up the phone.\n\nMerrill on Monday rolled out a revamped adviser-training program that prohibits participants from cold calling and directs would-be brokers to use internal referrals or LinkedIn messages to land clients instead. The decision comes after the program\u2019s 3,000 trainees were told to stop outbound recruiting efforts to find new customers last year after problematic phone calls.\n\nThe announcement formalizes a shift that executives have signaled for months. \u201cWe are leaning much more heavily on leads and referrals from the broader company,\u201d Merrill President Andy Sieg said in April. \u201cThere is also an opportunity to be much more modern in terms of the way we are reaching out to prospective clients.\u201d\n\nMerrill\u2019s training program, first established in 1945, was meant to be the firm\u2019s pipeline for new advisers after it cut back on the expensive practice of poaching from other firms. The pool of candidates that starts off in the program, which pays a base salary of $65,000 a year, is typically young and diverse. Participants who fail to meet the goals are kicked out or moved to other roles in the bank.\n\nIn recent years, only a small portion of trainees completed the program. Successful recruits often had extensive personal networks and were less reliant on cold calling, trainees said.",

        "199": "The ransomware attack that hobbled the Irish healthcare system was far from an isolated incident. and note that the FBI has issued a flash alert warning that the ransomware group behind the Ireland attack also targeted \"at least\" 16 healthcare and emergency networks, including police and 911 dispatch centers. The group used Conti ransomware that steals files, encrypts systems and pressures victims into paying through a portal lest their data be sold or published online.\n\nThe FBI didn't identify the victims or say if they'd paid ransoms.\n\nThe Conti ransomware is believed to be under the control of the Russia-based Wizard Spider cybercrime gang. The code shares some connections with the Ryuk ransomware and even uses that malware's distribution channels.\n\nThe perpetrators behind the Irish attack released a free decryptor after realizing the nature of their victim, but they still said they'd release or sell data. They'd originally demanded a ransom. The issue, of course, is that this group might use similar tactics. Healthcare operations and personal data might be at risk even if attackers waive ransoms, and those that do pay might inadvertently encourage future attacks.",
        "200": "GUANGZHOU, China \u2014 Chinese bitcoin traders continue to thrive despite Beijing's four-year crackdown on cryptocurrencies, experts told CNBC. On Friday, Chinese Vice Premier Liu He said it is necessary to \"crack down on Bitcoin mining and trading behavior\" to prevent risks to the \"social field.\" For a long time, Chinese authorities have been concerned about the speculative nature of cryptocurrencies and their risk to the stability of the financial system. The vice premier's latest comments have sparked fears of an intensified crackdown. But tough words from Beijing are not new. In 2017, China shut down local cryptocurrency exchanges and banned so-called initial coin offerings (ICOs), a way to raise money for crypto companies by issuing digital tokens. In November 2015, about 92% of bitcoin trading was done with the Chinese currency renminbi, according to data from CryptoCompare, a cryptocurrency data company. Chinese traders had the ability to move the market quite significantly on any news related to bitcoin in China. But by November 2017, Chinese renminbi accounted for just 0.07% of the total bitcoin market.\n\nHowever, that masks the fact that Chinese traders still remain a significant force in bitcoin trade, according to Matthew Graham, CEO of Sino Global Capital, a Beijing-based venture capital firm focused on blockchain technologies. \"The waning influence of Chinese bitcoin traders is an exaggerated story,\" Graham told CNBC. \"The fact is that Chinese traders still wield enormous influence.\" China's role in bitcoin was thrust back into the spotlight last week after authorities reiterated that financial institutions should not get involved in cryptocurrency businesses such as trading or helping to exchange fiat into digital coins. These were not new regulations.\n\nBut it was one of the reasons for the plunge in bitcoin last Wednesday, which at one point fell 30% to just over $30,000 before seeing a recovery. Chinese investors were also selling, but their trades may have been motivated by other factors. \"For clarity, anecdotally skittish Chinese retail investors were heavily involved in yesterday's sell-off. But this was more a function of price action than anything to do with local regulations,\" Graham said Thursday.\n\nWhat has happened to Chinese bitcoin trading?\n\nAs China increased its scrutiny of the cryptocurrency sector, a sort of grey market was created. Chinese exchanges such Huobi and OKEx moved offshore since they were not able to be licensed on the mainland. Some of these platforms offer crypto-to-crypto trading such as buying bitcoin with the U.S. dollar-linked stablecoin called tether (USDT). Some platforms offer a renminbi to USDT conversion service which allows Chinese users to get the crypto required to buy bitcoin.\n\n\"Once someone has purchased Bitcoin, they can then deposit it on overseas exchanges that allow crypto to crypto trading,\" Constantine Tsavliris, head of research at CryptoCompare, said. In early September 2009, when China ordered local cryptocurrency exchanges to shut down, bitcoin was trading at just over $4,000. On Tuesday, it stood at over $38,000, according to CoinDesk data. \"I think there is more (Chinese) traders (now). Bitcoin has gained an order of magnitude in price,\" Bobby Lee, former CEO of one of China's earliest cryptocurrency exchanges BTCC, told CNBC. \"These days, more and more people are using stable currencies like USDT,\" said Lee, who is also the founder of cryptocurrency wallet Ballet. \"What that means is they no longer have to deal with RMB transfers, it is moving to a USDT payments society and moving into and out of bitcoin. It's becoming an underground currency.\"",

A representative for Port of San Diego Harbor Police could not immediately be reached for more information.\n\n\u201cWe do not condone or tolerate verbal or physical abuse of our flight crews, who are responsible for the safety of our passengers,\u201d Southwest spokesman Chris Mainz said in an email.\n\nIn an open letter to CEO Gary Kelly, the president of Transport Workers Union Local 556 \u2014 the union for Southwest flight attendants \u2014 wrote that the Sunday incident was not isolated. There were 477 cases of passenger misconduct on the airline between April 8 and May 15, Lyn Montgomery wrote.\n\nThe reported increase in misconduct is not limited to Southwest. The Federal Aviation Administration said earlier this month that it was reviewing 1,300 reports of bad behavior by passengers since February \u2014 after initiating 1,300 such cases in the prior decade.\n\n\u201cBut my flight attendants will tell me it could be the state of unrest in the nation, the mask compliance, covid and being locked down for so long,\u201d she said. \u201cThere is definitely more aggression and hostility toward flight attendants who are just trying to do their basic job.\u201d\n\nIn her letter, Montgomery asked that the airline educate passengers on the civil penalties or criminal charges they could face for bad behavior and more effectively use the Southwest \u201crestricted travelers list.\u201d She said no passenger who is removed from a Southwest flight for noncompliance should be allowed to board the next one. Mainz, the spokesman, said the airline does not release the number of people on its no-fly list.\n\n\u201cWe ask that you take a strong stance to ensure that unruly passengers are not welcome to travel with us, period, full stop,\u201d Montgomery wrote.\n\nThe letter also asked Kelly to demand that the government put more federal air marshals on planes and ask that they get involved when a cabin crew member is threatened.\n\nMainz said in an email that the airline is partnering with the FAA on investigations so the agency can take action when appropriate.",

Earlier this month, the FDA authorized the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for use in adolescents ages 12 to 15. (The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine was initially authorized for use in people ages 16 and up, while Moderna\u2019s was initially authorized for use in people ages 18 and up.)\n\nFor the clinical trial, researchers enrolled 3,732 adolescent ages 12 to 17. Two-thirds were randomly assigned to get the vaccine, while the remaining third received a placebo. The vaccinated group produced immune responses as strong as those seen in vaccinated adults, Moderna reported in a press release Tuesday.\n\nThere were no cases of symptomatic COVID-19 among adolescents who had received both doses of the Moderna vaccine; there were four cases in the placebo group. The company noted that this was \u201cconsistent with a vaccine efficacy of 100 percent.\u201d However, the trial was primarily designed to evaluate immune responses in adolescents, not establish efficacy rate.\n\nResearchers also looked for very mild infections after trial participants received their first shot. Mild infections were defined as those in adolescents with a positive coronavirus test but just one COVID symptom (rather than two or more, which is often used). Using this definition, researchers found that just one shot of the vaccine was 93 percent effective.\n\nThe vaccine appeared safe in the young group and produced no serious side effects. Adolescents reported similar mild to moderate side effects as adults, including pain at the injection site after the first shot and headache, fatigue, myalgia, and chills after the second.\n\nIn a statement, Moderna CEO St\u00e9phane Bancel said the company was \u201cencouraged\u201d by the results. \u201cWe will submit these results to the U.S. FDA and regulators globally in early June and request authorization. We remain committed to doing our part to help end the COVID-19 pandemic.\u201d",

Maria Cantwell, D-Wash., and Roger Wicker, R-Miss., introduced an amendment that would authorize up to $10 billion for two teams to continue working on the lunar lander \u2013 as opposed to one.\n\nThe amendment stipulates that competitiveness should be maintained within the human landing system program by \"funding design, development, testing, and evaluation for not fewer than 2 entities.\"\n\nAs previously reported by FOX Business, Blue Origin recently lost a $2.9 billion NASA contract to build the lunar landing craft that will return astronauts to the moon for the first time in decades.

        "206": "Tesla Model Y and Model 3 vehicles bound for North American customers are being built without radar, fulfilling a desire by CEO Elon Musk to only use cameras combined with machine learning to support its advanced driver assistance system and other active safety features.\n\nLike many of Tesla\u2019s moves, the decision to stop using the sensor runs counter to the industry standard. For now, the radar-less cars will only be sold in North America. Tesla didn\u2019t state when or if it might remove the radar sensor in vehicles built for Chinese and European customers. Automakers typically use a combination of radar and cameras \u2014 and even lidar \u2014 to provide the sensing required to deliver advanced driver assistance system features like adaptive cruise control, which matches the speed of a car to surrounding traffic, as well as lane keeping and automatic lane changes.\n\nMusk has touted the potential of its branded \u201cTesla Vision\u201d system, which only uses cameras and so-called neural net processing to detect and understand what is happening in the environment surrounding the vehicle and then respond appropriately. Neural nets are a form of machine learning that work similarly to how humans learn. It is a sophisticated form of artificial intelligence algorithm that allows a computer to learn by using a series of connected networks to identify patterns in data. Many companies developing self-driving tech use deep neural networks to handle specific problems. But they wall off the deep nets and use rules-based algorithms to tie into the broader system.\n\nThe company detailed the transition away from radar in an update on its website, noting that the switch started this month. This camera-plus-machine learning (specifically neural net processing) approach has been dubbed Tesla Vision and will be used in its standard Autopilot advanced driver assistance system as well as in its $10,000 upgraded feature that has been branded Full Self-Driving or FSD. Tesla vehicles are not self-driving and require a human driver to remain engaged.\n\nTesla vehicles that are delivered without radar will initially limit Autopilot, including the lane-keeping feature known as Autosteer. For a short period of time, Autosteer will be limited to a maximum speed of 75 mph and a longer minimum following distance. The system\u2019s emergency lane departure avoidance feature and smart summon, which allows the driver to summon its vehicle in a parking lot, may be disabled at delivery, Tesla said.\n\nThe company plans to restore these features through wireless software updates in the coming weeks. Tesla didn\u2019t provide a specific timeline. All other available Autopilot and Full Self-Driving features will be active at delivery, depending on order configuration, the company said.\n\nMeanwhile, new Model S and Model X vehicles as well as every model built for markets outside of North America, will continue to be equipped with radar and will have radar-supported Autopilot functionality.\n\n\u201cModel 3 and Model Y are our higher volume vehicles,\u201d Tesla noted in its frequently asked questions section. \u201cTransitioning them to Tesla Vision first allows us to analyze a large volume of real-world data in a short amount of time, which ultimately speeds up the roll-out of features based on Tesla Vision.\u201d",

        "212": "\u201cWe don\u2019t always agree, but we always understand there is an opportunity to improve,\u201d said Darren W. Woods, the chairman and chief executive of Exxon Mobil.\n\nThe oil company will hold a contested election for four board seats at its annual shareholders meeting on Wednesday.\n\nHOUSTON \u2014 Exxon Mobil\u2019s management will face a big challenge over its climate change policies at an annual shareholder meeting on Wednesday as activists contest the election of one-third of the company\u2019s board. Analysts who follow the company said they could not recall an election in which board candidates nominated by Exxon had lost. A defeat for even one of its nominees would be a rebuke to Darren W. Woods, Exxon\u2019s chairman and chief executive. Led by Engine No. 1, an activist hedge fund, a coalition of investors concerned about the environment has argued that Exxon has not invested enough in cleaner energy, which will hurt its profits in the future. These investors argue that the company should follow European oil companies like BP and Total that have begun investing heavily in renewables like wind and solar energy. Much depends on whether much larger Exxon shareholders back Engine No. 1\u2019s campaign. All eyes are on BlackRock, the world\u2019s largest asset manager, which has cast itself as a leader in efforts to press companies to do more to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide and other gases that cause global warming.\n\nEngine No. 1 is seeking to defeat the election of four of the company\u2019s 12 director candidates with four of its own. Some big pension funds, including the New York State Common Retirement Fund and the California Public Employees\u2019 Retirement System, have joined Engine No. 1, which was started last year. \u201cWe listen, and we hear,\u201d Mr. Woods said in an interview in which he tried to take a conciliatory tone. \u201cWe don\u2019t always agree, but we always understand there is an opportunity to improve.\u201d Exxon has argued that it is addressing climate change via its investments in technology that captures carbon at factories, before it is released in the atmosphere, and stores it. This technology includes a proposal involving emissions from industrial plants along the Houston Ship Channel. On Monday, it announced that later this year it would add two new directors to the board, including a climate expert, but it has not committed to investing in renewable energy. Engine No. 1 dismissed Exxon\u2019s Monday announcement. \u201cWhat the board needs are directors with experience in successful and profitable energy industry transformations,\u201d the hedge fund said in a statement. \u201cThis vote is too important to be influenced by this type of cynical, last-minute maneuvering.\u201d Energy analysts say the dissidents could win seats on the board, but that would not necessarily change Exxon\u2019s direction substantially, at least not immediately given that most of the board would still be made up of directors picked by the company\u2019s management.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t expect a meaningful change in strategy such as large investments in renewables,\u201d said Allen Good, a Morningstar analyst. But he said a victory for the dissidents \u201cwould be a signal that shareholders don\u2019t think current initiatives have gone far enough, and that could spur further change.\u201d There have been several challenges to Exxon\u2019s management over the years, but the dissidents gained strength last year when the company did not increase its dividend and slashed its $200 billion investment program by a third. And the company\u2019s stock dropped by nearly half. Its share price has regained much of those losses in recent months but remains about 17 percent lower than it was in January 2020, before the pandemic took hold. Engine No. 1\u2019s candidates are Gregory Goff, a former chief executive of Andeavor, a refinery company; Kaisa Hietala, a former executive at Neste, a Finnish energy company; Alexander Karsner, a senior strategist at X, a lab owned by Google\u2019s parent, Alphabet; and Anders Runevad, the former chief executive of Vestas Wind Systems, a wind turbine maker. Much depends on whether shareholders with large stakes in Exxon vote with Engine No. 1. Reuters reported on Tuesday that BlackRock, which has a 6.7 percent stake in Exxon, had backed Engine No. 1\u2019s campaign by voting for three of the hedge fund\u2019s candidates. A BlackRock representative declined to comment on the report or its Exxon votes. BlackRock\u2019s critics say its deeds have not matched its talk on getting companies to do more to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. But the investment firm has said that engaging with management has produced results, and it has contended that voting against directors proposed by management can compel companies to make changes that would benefit the environment. BlackRock said that last year it voted against 64 directors on the boards of companies that generate a lot of carbon emissions. This year, BlackRock told The New York Times that its ambition was for its entire investment portfolio to be at \u201cnet zero\u201d emissions by 2050 at the latest. In other words, the companies and other entities in which BlackRock invests would, in aggregate, be adding zero planet-warming gases to the atmosphere because they took out as much as they put in.",

That was wider than the loss of 57 cents per share that analysts were anticipating, based on Refinitiv data.\n\nIt reported total revenue of $3.01 billion, up from $2.12 billion a year earlier. That beat expectations for $2.90 billion.\n\nNet sales, which don't include credit card revenue, were up 44% from the year-ago period, when Nordstrom's stores were closed for roughly half the quarter due to restrictions put in place during the Covid pandemic. But net sales were down 13% relative to the same period in fiscal 2019.\n\nThe company said it has added 20% more items for shoppers to choose from, compared with two years ago, as it invests more in the home, active and kids categories.\n\nFor Nordstrom's full-price brand, net sales rose 37% compared with a year earlier, but were down 13% from 2019. Nordstrom Rack's net sales increased 59% year over year, but were also down 13% on a two-year basis.\n\nNeil Saunders, managing director at GlobalData Retail, pointed out that Nordstrom Rack's results lag those of rivals TJX and Ross Stores, both of which have returned to pre-pandemic sales levels.\n\n\"The whole off-price segment is in the midst of a significant growth spurt as the consumer economy opens back up,\" Saunders said in a note to clients. \"In our view, Nordstrom Rack is simply not participating in this boom to the same degree as others.\"\n\nNordstrom's digital sales rose 23% from 2020 levels, and were up 28% compared with the same period in 2019. Nordstrom said its e-commerce business represented 46% of total sales in the latest quarter.\n\nThe rate of people completing their purchases was up 15% from 2019 levels, Nordstrom said, as more customers came to its website and stores with the intent of buying something.\n\nCEO Erik Nordstrom cited ongoing strength at both its Nordstrom stores and its off-price Nordstrom Rack business that targets more cost-conscious customers, for the year-over-year sales growth. He said the company is optimistic about being able to capitalize on \"pent-up demand\" during the summer months ahead.\n\nThe company's annual Anniversary Sale is timed for the second quarter of this year, he added, which should align with more Americans returning to pre-pandemic activities and refreshing their wardrobes.\n\nStill, the department store chain reaffirmed its fiscal 2021 outlook that calls for revenue growth of more than 25%. It also anticipates digital will drive half of its business by year-end.\n\nRetailers Macy's and Kohl's both recently reported fiscal first-quarter earnings that beat Street estimates and hiked their respective 2021 outlooks.\n\n\"While there is still considerable uncertainty with respect to Covid-19, we remain confident in our ability to deliver on our targets for 2021 and generate profitable sales growth as demand recovers,\" Nordstrom CFO Anne Bramman said in prepared remarks.\n\nAs of market close Tuesday, Nordstrom shares are up about 17% year to date.

The stock has more than tripled (up 236%) in the past six months, as the Reddit crowd has gone gaga over the meme company.\n\nAs for Bazinet, he said AMC remains overvalued, Bloomberg reports.

        "215": "(Kitco News) The gold market was one of the last assets to rise on inflation fear headlines, and that is because there has been a regime change in the precious metal market, said Portfolio Wealth Advisors president and CIO Lee Munson.\n\nInvestors shouldn't rush to buy gold because they fear a crisis or hyperinflation. For gold, it is now all about the central bank's expansion of the balance sheet, Munson told Kitco News, adding that gold will rise to $2,200 before the Federal Reserve starts raising rates.\n\n\"I don't buy gold for a crisis. I buy it because when there's a crisis, and I think the central banks are going to print money like there's no tomorrow, that's the time when I want to have a larger holding of gold,\" he said. \"My ultimate target in this cycle of money printing is $2,200 an ounce. That's between here and when the Fed starts to raise.\"\n\nMunson makes a distinction between gold climbing along with the balance sheet expansion and not with inflation fears because not all countries will end up getting hyperinflation with massive money printing. But gold will still be a winner either way.\n\n\"I don't think that inflation and gold are really that tightly connected. Gold moves are related to inflation. One of the biggest problems people have with gold is walking around saying it's an inflation hedge. But that's not necessarily true. We had plenty of inflation in the 80s, 90s, and gold went down. But, when you have countries outside the U.S. that have hyperinflation, and the money gets debased, gold is a store value. It's been that way for thousands of years. That's why people buy it because they're worried about their currency being debased,\" Munson explained.\n\nTo understand gold price moves better, investors need to watch the expansion of the money supply. \"It's the expansion of the federal balance sheet. That to me is what really drives the price of gold versus just inflation picking up,\" he said.\n\nAnd right now, the U.S. is going through a period of money printing that won't stop until the first half of 2023. \"And if the past is anything like the future, which it should rhyme, then gold has some legs beyond the crisis,\" Munson pointed out.\n\nAlso, the Fed is forced to keep rates lower for longer every time there is a recessionary environment in light of all the corporate and household debt.\n\nInflation is definitely a risk, but people are overreacting to the magnitude of the actual price pressures, he added. \"Getting up to 3% inflation would be very dramatic. And I think many people are thinking of the late 70s, early 80s type of inflation \u2014 when gold peaked. I don't think that's the magnitude we'll get,\" Munson said.\n\nThe U.S. Treasury and the Federal Reserve are more concerned about deflation than inflation, and all they want is to see if the U.S. economy can even get above and stay above the 2% inflation target for a few quarters in a row.\n\n\"The Treasury and the Fed need to keep these rates lower so they can keep stimulating because right now they are concerned about deflation, not inflation, and that's a regime change,\" Munson noted. \"And thus, we have a regime change in gold because now our central bank is much more concerned about trying to get to 2%, 2.5%, 3% for more than like a month.\"\n\nA lot of investors are assuming that inflation will jump and the Federal Reserve will overreact. Munson added that he is not convinced that will happen.\n\n\"There's a lot of evidence that it's just the expansion of that balance sheet that gold reacts to. I understand that in many situations and in many different countries, the expansion of the balance sheet leads to hyperinflation due to the debasement of the currency. But I think that that's too easy of a read on it for the U.S. It's more about how much money is printed, not necessary if there's core inflation,\" Munson said. \"We're choosing a populous path of modern monetary theory. And everybody in the world knows it. That is why the U.S. dollar is going to continue to struggle.\"\n\nBut the Federal Reserve is unlikely to lose control because they control the money and the rates, he stated.",

It's the latest trading volatility in the commodities sector as the pandemic and the economic reopening distorted markets and led to big speculation in areas like lumber.\n\nCorn came under pressure a day after the U.S. Department of Agriculture said in a Crop Progress report that U.S. farmers had planted 90% of intended corn acres as of Sunday, ahead of the five-year average of 80%.\n\nThe above-pace planting, the result of sufficient rain in the U.S. Midwest, appeared to counter concerns stemming from lingering Chinese demand for corn.\n\nCorn, like other agricultural commodities, has seen its price climb over the last 12 months as businesses work to preempt future inflation and resupply inventory as economies return to normal activity after the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nIncluding Tuesday's pullback, corn futures are up 28% in 2021 and 95% over the past year.\n\nCorn is a crucial component in many items at supermarkets, ranging from tortilla chips to bourbon.

        "219": "Electric vehicle startups have raised an absurd amount of money in the last year by merging with special purpose acquisition companies, or SPACs. That money \u2014 billions of dollars, collectively \u2014 was supposed to be enough to help each of them start fighting for space in a market dominated by Tesla. But many of these startups are still having trouble getting rolling.\n\nEV startup struggles are not new. Most of the ones focused on passenger vehicles that are still around spent years grappling with the inherent, unavoidable difficulties of automotive manufacturing. Now, though, the bruises of that fight are developing in broad daylight \u2014 all while they try to beat deep-pocketed legacy automakers to the punch.\n\nStartups going public makes it much easier to see where the problems are\n\nOhio-based Lordstown Motors raised nearly $700 million when it went public late last year and has backing from America\u2019s largest automaker, General Motors. But it\u2019s spending faster than expected \u2014 it lost $125 million in the first quarter \u2014 and on Tuesday, the company said it needs more cash in order to hit its goal of making its first 2,200 electric pickup trucks by the end of 2021.\n\nCalifornia-based Canoo went public in December and has already replaced its leadership team. The new one has upended the startup\u2019s business model and largely thrown out the projections that were used to raise around $600 million during last year\u2019s merger with a SPAC.\n\nStartups that have announced SPAC mergers but have yet to complete them have run into some trouble, too. Lucid Motors again delayed the release of its luxury electric sedan, the Air, in order to address quality assurance issues raised by its investors. When it does go public, the California startup is looking to add $4.4 billion to the sizable war chest it started building when Saudi Arabia pledged some $1.3 billion in exchange for majority control in 2018.\n\nAnother California EV startup working on a luxury electric vehicle, Faraday Future, is set to raise $1 billion when its own SPAC merger is complete. But this week, Faraday Future told investors that it needs to recalculate basically all of the financial projections it made so far in order to follow new guidance from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Other startups have had to make similar adjustments.\n\nThe pandemic has only made things harder\n\nSome of these problems are the result of bad timing. These companies are trying to debut vehicles at a time when the pandemic has put a ton of stress on the automotive supply chain. Lucid Motors CEO Peter Rawlinson told Bloomberg on Wednesday that \u201cCOVID has wrecked havoc with our process.\u201d On Tuesday, Lordstown Motors said the pandemic has created \u201csignificantly higher than expected expenditures for parts/equipment, expedited shipping costs, and expenses associated with third-party engineering resources.\u201d\n\nBut these startups also rushed to become public companies so they could take advantage of the deluge of money during the SPAC merger boom. That has left them scrambling to cope with the demands of being listed on a major stock exchange. On Canoo\u2019s first earnings call as a publicly traded company, for example, an analyst called out the startup\u2019s head of investor relations for not returning emails. In response, CEO Tony Aquila admitted to the team being \u201coverwhelmed.\u201d\n\nNot all of the side effects of this rush to market have been so frivolous, though. Nearly all of these startups have disclosed so-called \u201cmaterial weaknesses\u201d in their internal financial practices in filings with the SEC. Faraday Future admitted that, among other things, it \u201cdid not design and maintain effective controls for communicating and sharing information between the legal and accounting and finance departments,\u201d and that it was not able to \u201caddress the identification of and accounting for certain non-routine, unusual or complex transactions\u201d \u2014 which is notable considering the startup\u2019s well-documented history with unusual and complex financial transactions.\n\nFisker Inc., which raised $1 billion in its own merger last year, admitted to weaknesses in its \u201crisk assessment process, including as it relates to fraud risks.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s more, multiple electric vehicle startups are now under government investigation. The SEC is probing Lordstown Motors over claims that it misrepresented the number of preorders for its trucks. It\u2019s also investigating Canoo\u2019s SPAC merger, as well as the recent executive departures. Both the SEC and the Department of Justice have opened investigations into hydrogen trucking startup Nikola, which was one of the earliest electric vehicle companies to go public in a SPAC merger. And if that weren\u2019t enough, all of these startups have been hit with multiple securities fraud lawsuits from shareholders alleging they were misled.\n\nOnly Lordstown Motors and Lucid Motors remain committed to starting production by the end of 2021, which means most of these startups are still a long way away from generating revenue, let alone turning a profit. The only exception so far is Fisker Inc., which sold $22,000 worth of merchandise in the first quarter \u2014 though the cost of those sales was $17,000, meaning the company netted just $5,000.\n\nWithout any near-term revenue, these EV startups are now in a sort of race to get into production before their massive piles of cash run out. And some are already looking for more help, buoyed by the fact that many of them were able to use funds from the SPAC mergers to wipe out any existing debt.\n\nFisker Inc. founder Henrik Fisker has already said he is open to borrowing money to make sure his company meets a late 2022 production target. Lordstown Motors said Tuesday that it is looking to borrow against some of its assets (which include a former GM factory and equipment). It\u2019s also talking to strategic investors and is in the running for a loan from the Department of Energy\u2019s Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing program, from which Tesla once borrowed.\n\nIf the startup isn\u2019t able to raise more money, Lordstown Motors CEO Steve Burns said it will have to cut its production target to around 1,000 trucks this year.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to make sure everybody knew the worst, worst case\u201d\n\n\u201cWe wanted to make sure everybody knew the worst, worst case is we are still making pickup trucks this year,\u201d Burns said.\n\nLordstown Motors is especially under pressure, as the startup is focused on making and selling its electric pickup, the Endurance, exclusively to commercial customers. But Ford not only just revealed an all-electric version of its bestselling truck, the F-150, it also showed off a fleet-focused version with a cheaper base price than the Endurance.\n\nBurns, without mentioning the Detroit automaker or its new truck by name, said this week the F-150 Lightning launch helped prove that electric pickups are now a \u201cmainstream\u201d idea. He remained confident that Lordstown Motors could beat Ford to market, as the Lightning is not supposed to go on sale until the first half of 2022. But, he said, it \u201cwould be crushing to have the lead, have a first market mover, and not be able to fulfill [that goal].\u201d",
        "220": "As AT&T and Discovery discussed putting together their content assets, they specifically structured a deal to give the combined company flexibility to merge or sell down the road \u2014 perhaps to Apple. Apple is one of the few companies that has the balance sheet to buy WarnerMedia-Discovery, a company that will likely have a market capitalization of more than $100 billion when it begins trading publicly next year, assuming regulatory approval. But it's not clear whether Apple has any interest in a major media acquisition. The company's history suggests Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook would shy away from a huge deal. Apple's biggest deal ever was a mere $3 billion \u2014 for headphones maker Beats Electronics in 2014. To put that in perspective, Apple has a market valuation of more than $2.1 trillion. Apple's growing market power is also under increasing scrutiny by regulators and has been the subject of a recently concluded court trial brought by Fortnite maker Epic. Shelling out $100 billion or more for an external company may sound alarm bells with politicians that Cook would rather not ring. But, to quote a frequently used investment phrase, past performance is no guarantee of future results. Apple has made a relatively small investment in original content, with such series as \"Ted Lasso\" and \"The Morning Show,\" and Apple TV+ remains a minnow among streaming giants Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, Disney and the newly combined WarnerMedia-Discovery. If Apple wants to compete, the easiest way forward is to buy a media giant \u2014 and there are already some historical ties between WarnerMedia and Apple.\n\nIn 2015, Cook, Eddy Cue, Apple's senior vice president of internet software and services, Jeff Bewkes, CEO of the then-named Time Warner, and former Time Warner Executive Vice President Olaf Olafsson met to discuss partnership opportunities around Apple exclusively offering Time Warner's content, according to people familiar with the matter. The meetings were reported by the Financial Times in 2016, but CNBC has learned of additional details. The four executives discussed offering Turner and HBO content outside of the cable bundle for about $19 per month, said a person familiar with the contents of the conversation, who asked not to be named because the discussions were private. While Time Warner was already offering HBO Go separately from the traditional pay-TV ecosystem for $15 per month, taking CNN, TBS, TNT and other Turner networks outside of the broader cable bundle would have been a groundbreaking step. Even today, nearly six years later, consumers can't buy a monthly subscription to a company's linear networks separate from the larger cable bundle. The broader idea of selling direct-to-consumer has taken over the media ecosystem, with every major media company offering a streaming product of its own. The executives discussed the possibility of Apple being the exclusive provider of the offer, giving Apple device users the ability to purchase the Time Warner bundle through the iTunes store. Over a series of weeks, both Apple and Time Warner soured on the idea. Taking Turner's networks outside the cable bundle would likely have led to a chorus of angry pay-TV distributors who thought they were paying for exclusive content. And Apple already offered media content \u2014 movies and TV shows \u2014 from a large number of media companies through the iTunes store. Time Warner wanted Apple to market the bundle globally, but Apple was hesitant to annoy its other media partners. During the talks, Bewkes and Cook broached the subject of Apple acquiring Time Warner to deal with one of the biggest hurdles of the $19-per-month concept: What if Apple or Time Warner eventually wanted to back out? Once the companies went live with the offer, they'd need to stay aligned. Walking away from the deal could be disastrous to both companies' external relationships. Cue expressed interest in a full acquisition, but Cook ultimately wasn't ready to pull the trigger on what likely would have been a nearly $100 billion deal, two of the people said. Neither Bewkes nor Cook had initially expected the talks to lead to thoughts of an acquisition, said the people. Time Warner had successfully fought off a hostile takeover offer from Fox a year earlier. A year later, in late 2016, Bewkes agreed to sell Time Warner to AT&T for more than $105 billion including debt.\n\nApple has another significant tie to WarnerMedia \u2014 former HBO chief Richard Plepler. Plepler left HBO after disagreeing with current AT&T CEO John Stankey about the direction of the premium network, as detailed by CNBC last year. Months later, he signed a five-year deal with Apple TV+ to produce TV series, documentaries and feature films exclusively for the streaming service. The coronavirus pandemic delayed the production of most of Plepler's efforts, but some of his work at Eden Productions is beginning to trickle out, such as the limited series \"In With The Devil,\" starring Greg Kinnear, Sepideh Moafi, Taron Egerton and Ray Liotta. If Cook wants to know inside details about HBO, he's got someone on his payroll to ask. Apple TV+ accounts for just 3.7% of the company's total services revenue, according to Barclays analyst Tim Long. Free trial periods end in July, which is likely to lead to increased churn. Apple TV+ probably had about 40 million total subscribers \u2014 many on free trials \u2014 at the end of 2020, Barclays estimated. \"Overall, Apple TV+ has underperformed versus original expectations after its launch at the end of 2019,\" Long said in a note to clients. \"We think Apple's budget for producing original content is far below the amount Netflix has spent in the last decade. It could take years and still not move the needle.\" If Apple wants to stay in the streaming video world, Cook may need to buck the company's history of avoiding big-money M&A. The WarnerMedia-Discovery deal isn't expected to close until mid-2022. That gives Cook a year to do some serious thinking about his company's future.",

        "222": "The pandemic hit the world of clothing rental hard. Now, companies like Rent the Runway say the market is booming like never before.\n\nIt\u2019s been more than a year since the coronavirus brought events and socializing to a screeching halt, prompting much of the United States to settle into sweatpants and stay indoors for months on end. Yet in recent weeks \u2014 and particularly in parts of the country where life is edging back toward normalcy \u2014 there is a post-pandemic ebullience emerging in how Americans are dressing. Traditional retailers like T.J. Maxx and Macy\u2019s have reported a surge in apparel sales. And clothing rental platforms such as Rent the Runway say they are reaping the benefits after a perilous year of layoffs and slashing budgets. Rent the Runway\u2019s chief executive, Jennifer Hyman, said this month that users had been returning to the service in droves. Since a pandemic low last May, there has been a 92 percent increase in active subscribers \u2014 lured in part by recent discounts \u2014 and the number of customers was on track to outpace 2019 levels by the end of the year. Traditional rental hubs in the South such as Texas, Florida and Georgia were the first to show signs of recovery this year, though they are not yet back to 2019 subscriber counts, she added. Cities like Charleston, S.C.; Charlotte, N.C.; Nashville; and Phoenix saw large increases in entirely new subscribers, and growth has also come from smaller cities where the company had not done as much business, like Chapel Hill, N.C., and Knoxville, Tenn. In the New York metro area, the company\u2019s average number of new subscribers each day in May was four and a half times higher than in February.\n\nDaring new trends have also started to emerge in terms of what women want to wear \u2014 bolder, brighter and sexier styles than ever before. Some companies are calling this peacocking or hedonism, while Rent the Runway has been referring to it as the new \u201cjoie de vivre.\u201d \u201cThis is something we are seeing across the country in every age segment and is so different from anything we\u2019ve seen in our 13 years of business,\u201d Ms. Hyman said. The company\u2019s data offers a near real-time view into what people are wearing \u2014 or not wearing. For example, it has seen four times the demand for crop tops in 2021 compared with 2019, including triple the demand from women 35 and older, plus a 44 percent increase in searches for outfits with cutouts. Cutouts aren\u2019t just for the nightclub \u2014 they\u2019re also making appearances at baby showers, the company said.\n\n\u201cColorful, optimistic clothes, bags and jewelry are being rented by women of all sizes \u2014 the same styles are popular from size 4 to 20,\u201d Ms. Hyman said. \u201cPeople are really in the mood to get back out into the world and celebrate.\u201d Despite her company\u2019s enduring such a sustained period of uncertainty and low revenues, she insisted that she felt bullish about the prospects for the fashion rental market. \u201cAfter being trapped away from the people we love for long periods of time, values will change,\u201d she said, noting that people had been stuck at home with \u201call the stuff that was purchased in the past that doesn\u2019t get used or that takes up valuable space.\u201d Consumer psychology has shifted irrevocably over the last 15 months. Along with a growing reliance on e-commerce and online services, greater concern for sustainability has prompted millions of consumers to reconsider their previous spending patterns. And the sharing economy continues to reshape numerous aspects of society, like the prioritizing of access over ownership. According to Claudia D\u2019Arpizio, a partner at Bain & Company who focuses on the fashion and luxury sector, the pandemic could actually make apparel rental \u2014 and its sister industry, fashion resale \u2014 among retail\u2019s biggest winners in a new era of consumption. \u201cWhen you ask young people in particular about secondhand and rental fashion, it is clear they believe it is the future,\u201d Ms. D\u2019Arpizio said. \u201cOf course, as this market grows, efficient delivery, returns and logistics \u2014 which have an environmental footprint of their own \u2014 become a more complex and expensive consideration. But the fact that you now have an increasing number of old-guard brands and retailers entering the space underscores the fact that the industry thinks it is an opportunity that is only going to grow.\u201d\n\u2022 Fox News will replay prime-time shows on its streaming service.\n\u2022 Got milk? The U.S. asks for a panel to settle a dispute over dairy exports to Canada.\n\u2022 Today in On Tech: The big deal in Amazon\u2019s antitrust case Apparel sellers were pummeled last year, and Rent the Runway was no exception. Before Covid-19 hit, the New York-based company was rapidly expanding, with mailrooms at Wall Street firms piled high with its bags of returns on Mondays, and an expanding network of drop-off points at WeWork locations. It had introduced a partnership with West Elm for renting \u201cbundles\u201d of pillows and throws and declared its plan to \u201ccreate the Amazon Prime of rental.\u201d The spread of Covid-19 halted that momentum, ushering in a period of paranoia around sharing and touching common surfaces. Rent the Runway, which had previously allowed customers to put their subscriptions on hold for a few months, scrambled to offer an indefinite pause so that customers wouldn\u2019t drop the platform entirely. While some continued to rent sweaters and cozy clothing, many paused or left.\n\nMs. Hyman said the valuation dip did not mean anything. The company needed money to ensure it was prepared for any scenario, she said, pointing out that nobody knew when the pandemic would abate. Of all the changes Rent the Runway made to its business last year, the biggest was the shift from its unlimited offering, which had allowed subscribers to swap as many items as they wanted for a monthly fee. Now, it offers a few different tiers \u2014 users can rent up to four items per month, in one shipment, for $89, or up to 16 items, and up to four shipments, for $199. The new model appeals to a broader array of customers and is more cost effective and better for the environment, Ms. Hyman said, as it cuts down on the nonstop deliveries and dry cleaning. Traction in the men\u2019s wear rental market continues to be slow, but before the pandemic, the sector was surging for women. Urban Outfitters introduced its rental service, Nuuly, in 2019, and offerings had cropped up from a wide variety of mall chains and other brands, like Vince, Rebecca Taylor, H&M and Ganni. Major department stores such as Selfridges in London recently began high-profile women\u2019s wear rental programs, and this year Ralph Lauren became the first luxury brand to offer direct clothing rentals. For luxury brands, rental could represent 10 percent of revenue by 2030, according to a recent Bain & Company report. When an item is rented 20 times, for instance, it generates a profit margin of more than 40 percent, the report found. While rental clothing services and their monthly subscription fees became far less appealing during the pandemic, secondhand clothing sites flourished, with companies like Poshmark and ThredUp going public. Coresight Research estimated the size of the U.S. rental apparel market at $1.3 billion in 2019, and said it declined to $1.1 billion last year. The firm expects a rebound to \u201cat least\u201d $1.2 billion in 2021.\n\nThe company will soon allow even nonmembers to buy its clothing at a discount, a perk long available only to subscribers. And this month will see the arrival of a new board member: the actress and Goop founder Gwyneth Paltrow. Ms. Paltrow said she had taken on the role in part because of her respect for Ms. Hyman, and because the company had the opportunity to define itself and what it meant to its customers in a post-pandemic world. Does that mean she\u2019ll be getting a subscription? \u201cWhat\u2019s fascinating is that, in my own way, I\u2019ve been renting the runway for years,\u201d Ms. Paltrow said in an interview. \u201cBorrowing a dress from a designer for a single moment at a premiere or an awards show, then giving it back afterward. Now I guess everyone is doing it. But I\u2019ve got my welcome code in my inbox, so I\u2019ll soon be trying it out.\u201d",

There is a simpler and more effective way to stop the ransomware pandemic: Ban cryptocurrency.\n\nRansomware can\u2019t succeed without cryptocurrency. The pseudonymity that crypto provides has made it the exclusive method of payment for hackers. It makes their job relatively safe and easy. There is even a new business model in which developers sell or lease ransomware, empowering malicious actors who aren\u2019t tech-savvy themselves to receive payment quickly and securely. Before cryptocurrency, attackers had to set up shell companies to receive credit-card payments or request ransom payment in prepaid cash cards, leaving a trail in either case. It is no coincidence that ransomware attacks exploded with the emergence of cryptocurrency.\n\nBanning anything runs counter to the American ethos, but as our experience with social media should teach us, the innovative isn\u2019t always an unalloyed good. A sober assessment of cryptocurrency must conclude that the damage wrought by crypto-fueled ransomware vastly outweighs any benefits from cryptocurrency.\n\nIt isn\u2019t obvious that cryptocurrency provides any benefit at all beyond the chance to make a quick buck.

        "230": "Millions of people suddenly, if temporarily, found themselves freed of hundreds of dollars in monthly payments over the past year due to pandemic-related federal student loan forbearance. For many, it\u2019s been their first taste of financial comfort since borrowing money to fund their education. For the 43 million Americans with federal student loan debt, like myself, the reprieve from making monthly payments has not only afforded them small luxuries \u2014 a meal out, unnecessary personal care items, a new couch \u2014 but also meaningfully improved their quality of life. It has helped some people get closer to milestones that otherwise wouldn't have been possible for years: paying off credit card and medical debt, saving for a down payment on a home, or starting a family.\n\n Forbearance, which began in March 2020, is set to end in September, although that could be extended. Borrowers are now anxiously looking to President Joe Biden and Congress to see how long their debt-free existence will last \u2014 and to plan for what happens next. I\u2019m personally not sure what will happen when deferment ends and my $750 monthly loan payments resume. Since the pandemic began, I moved into an apartment with my boyfriend and paid for a hefty and unexpected medical bill. We decided to get a used car, for which we now have monthly payments. I don\u2019t know if I can afford the life I have now when loan forbearance ends, and that thought terrifies me. BuzzFeed News asked readers how student loan forbearance has impacted their life. We received more than 1,400 responses from people experiencing temporary relief as well as anxiety, anger, and confusion over a year since payments were paused. Here are some of their stories, which have been edited for clarity and length.\n\nI got my bachelor\u2019s degree from Old Dominion University and my master\u2019s from Troy. When I finished my education in 2003, I owed about $80,000 through the FFEL program. I was only making close to minimum wage, and I couldn't afford to start repaying my loans. I used the options I had at the time \u2014 forbearance and deferment. But even then, those loans were still accruing interest. When I finally started repaying, I had to pay $750 per month. I had to file for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in 2013 and couldn\u2019t afford the mortgage for my townhome anymore. I moved into an apartment, which allowed me to repay my student loans and pay for a roof over my head. I have paid down $60,000 in the last five years. You would think I wasn't that far from being debt-free, but because of interest I still owe $127,000. I was able to consolidate my loans during the pandemic. While my interest rate is still 6.385%, I can now take advantage of the CARES Act deferment until forbearance ends. I am still living paycheck to paycheck, but deferment has allowed me to put a little aside in savings for emergencies for the first time in a long time. After deferment ends, things will still be tight and I will have no more money going into savings. There's no way to get relief. Calculating everything, I'll be paying back $250,000 worth of interest on a loan that was only $80,000 to begin with. When I file my taxes, I don't get any money back from the interest. Now they say I make too much money to qualify for student loan deductions on my taxes. How am I given a good, fair shake to become debt-free? When I think about goals to become debt-free, I never even consider being able to pay off my student loan debt. I have five nieces and nephews who are going to be graduating this year. I've talked to them about doing community college and then going off to university after a few years. In the long run, it's just not worth it. I wish I had been more educated about it. When I filed for bankruptcy, I couldn't include my student loans. My attorneys said the judge is not going to forgive or include them. I would hope that the forbearance continues, because I'm responsible for paying so much interest. If Biden forgave $50,000, I would still have a big chunk to repay, but it wouldn't be as massive as it is now. The fact that it's currently in forbearance and not gaining more interest helps my household. My household always has to accommodate my student loan payments. It caused issues when we were trying to buy a home; it causes issues everywhere.\n\nSince loan forbearance began, I was able to move out to a nice area on my own and begin furnishing my apartment. I can save and invest \u2014 but I know that as long as I have student loans, I will never be able to afford a home on my own. I'm a Black woman in Phoenix, and the housing market is outrageous. It's not like I live somewhere extravagant. I'm constantly stressed about my loans and checking the news to see if there is any progress on cancellation. My peers make the most ignorant statements to me about money and I have to explain: I'm a Black woman, so, one, I'm not getting paid as much as you; two, I had to go into debt for my education; three, that debt is looming over me every day and influences every decision I make; and four, I have family to consider. Once forbearance ends, I don't know if I'll be able to afford my current place. I have been pushing myself through incredibly stressful promotions to make sure I can swing my loan payment in my monthly budget. I've also been saving to pay off a lump sum, but that would decrease my emergency savings significantly. I've always been an advocate for loan cancellation. It should not have cost me $50,000 to get the skills and knowledge I have. I used to fight on the phone with my financial aid offices for more grants because this is unjust and a scam. I check the news every day. I just read an article that asked, \u201cShould you change, or should you plan for the future of student loans getting canceled?\u201d I\u2019ve followed Elizabeth Warren for a long time since she seems like one of the only people who cares about student debt. Black Americans disproportionately have more student debt, and it makes it harder for us to get along. It's a constant stressor.\n\nIn the pandemic, my federal loans were paused, but my private student loans weren't. I've been throwing every dollar I can at my private loans to try to finish them off. Because of this effort, I was able to pay off $20,000 in private student loans in a year. I took this approach with the hope of some kind of federal student loan forgiveness on the horizon but with the awareness that these private loans weren't going anywhere. I have been a social worker for six years, and I work with the homeless. But my office is located in lower Manhattan, and because the NYS Licensed Social Worker Loan Forgiveness Program factors in the location of your employer, I\u2019m ineligible for $26,000 of forgiveness \u2014 even though I live in Forest Hills, Queens. If I can reach my goal of paying off my private loans before forbearance ends, I will be able to double the amount that was previously going toward my federal loans. Before forbearance, it was $600 to private, $600 to federal, which will then become $1,200 to federal. My husband and I have held off having kids. We live in a converted doctor\u2019s office that is 400 square feet and way below market rent for our neighborhood. A splurge for us is going out and splitting a cookie; one each is too extravagant. It feels like a massive hill that we have been climbing for years. The last year hasn't changed my perception much, except to maybe amplify my disgust with the system. At the very least, people earning degrees and training in jobs and fields that this country desperately needs or will need in the future shouldn't pay a dime to go to school. It's made me angry that it takes a massive economic downturn to get any help from the government. No one talked to me about what it would mean to have these loans when I was 18. They were just part of the piles of forms to be signed and submitted as part of registration and enrollment. My freshman year in college, we sat down with a really nice financial administrator at the school, and they handed me a big stack of papers. It felt like no big deal. Then when I graduated and went to go pick up my graduation ticket, I broke down into tears when I learned how much I owed. I wish student loan education were a requirement for high school graduation. My mom took out $7,000 more than I needed that first year I was in college; she thought of it as \u201cjust in case\u201d money. I shudder to think about that money accumulated with interest. I think community college and state school should be free. I am so insanely lucky to have kept my job and been able to make this huge financial dent in my loans when so many people are drowning. I dream of winning the Powerball and making giant \"Robert Smith at Morehouse\"\u2013level donations and paying for dozens of students to go to college for free, but then I think how messed up that is. Financial freedom shouldn't be a fantasy in America.\n\nI\u2019m a middle school reading specialist. I\u2019m going to be 32 soon. Five family members of mine have had ALS. After my mom died in 2019 [due to complications from ALS], we wanted to get started right away to try to have a kid. I decided to take the genetic test to see if I have the gene that causes ALS. I really had to work myself up to taking it. I started working with a geneticist, and I found out in December 2020 I do have the ALS gene. I have a high-90s percent chance that I will get ALS in my lifetime, which means there is a 50% chance that a child of mine will have ALS. With IVF, we are going through the entire process and doing genetic testing to ensure I don\u2019t pass this gene on to any future children. Between our personal savings that we\u2019ve been able to save by not having to pay student loans, our HSAs, and a friend who set up a GoFundMe for us, we have been able to save enough money to help us through the IVF process \u2014 which is expensive. Without this money, we would have had to put off IVF even longer. I am very lucky because both my partner and I have kept our jobs throughout the pandemic. Once I need to start paying [loans back] again, I think I\u2019ll be OK; I just don\u2019t think we\u2019ll be able to pay them back very quickly. We would be able to make our base payments \u2014 but of course if I am pregnant, we would be looking at paying for daycare, so who knows. We have been planning for a family for a while and specifically bought a house that didn\u2019t have a crazy mortgage. The biggest financial stressor would be our loans if no forgiveness is given. I now realize that the burden of these loans should not be placed on individual Americans. The government needs to do something for current loan holders and future and present students. Being strapped with thousands of dollars in student loans is causing people, in my experience, to wait longer to buy houses, have kids, or even just treat themselves.\n\nFor undergrad, I had no student loans. I got a full scholarship to UCLA. But I got my doctorate up in Oregon, and that was expensive \u2014 $40,000 per year. When I went into residency, you get to try out different places, and I was making $24,000 a year that first year of my fellowship. In California, the cost of living is so high. I don\u2019t go golfing every day. I don\u2019t belong to a country club. I work full days, and I\u2019m still struggling. I have three jobs right now. What you pay for student loans comes out of your pay after it\u2019s taxed, and so much of that goes to the interest. For a $700-per-month student loan payment, I need to earn around $1,100 pretax to meet that obligation. And I consider myself lucky with interest. My rate is 2%; I have colleagues whose interest rates are above 7%. When the pandemic hit, my clinic closed for three months. Now I have that hoarding mentality. I need the basic necessities for my family to be OK, and I need to take advantage of the student loan forbearance. If I don\u2019t pay my student loans now, I\u2019ll pay more later on, but it will be OK. If I don\u2019t pay my mortgage, I\u2019m out of a house. I love what I do. I\u2019m an optometrist. I\u2019ve been working for 17 years. Even if I won the Powerball tomorrow and I paid off my student loans, I would still work here. But all it would take is another outbreak of some virulent COVID strain and we could all shut down again. This experience has highlighted for me what is important to my family and me on a day-to-day basis. We weren\u2019t living lavishly before or during the pandemic. Everyone in my family still has their health. That\u2019s all that matters to me. Student loans, home payment, and others are just bills. Keep swimming. Make it through one day at a time. It will work out in the end. My brother and I are also helping my older parents with finances, home payments, and property taxes. My brother went to college and not to grad school afterward, and he does tons better than me. When forbearance ends, there will be less of a chance for me to save and get ahead. My wife and I have three boys, 10, 8, and 5. We\u2019ve already started talking to them about college and money. When I was at college at UCLA, it was $4,000 a year. Over the past 10 years, it\u2019s almost tripled in price. With the boys, we\u2019re doing our best to save for a 529 plan. My goal is for them to go wherever they want to go, but they need to realize that they need to work hard, too. If they want to major in basket weaving, that\u2019s fine, but they need to realize that they are going to have an income and money to manage themselves. It\u2019s frustrating. You\u2019re taught that to get ahead, you need school, school, then more school. You need money to go to school. So to get ahead, you need to fall behind.\n\nIt\u2019s been 13 months since my husband and I have made student loan payments. We both have graduate degrees, and we consider ourselves pretty privileged, especially for upstate New York, where we live. We\u2019ve been lucky during this pandemic that we both could work, and my husband got overtime money. With all the extra money from not making our student loan payments, we have been fortunate to save toward a house, where we plan to start our family. The housing market is insane now. Houses are going quickly and realtors and mortgage lenders pressure you to have your financial life in complete order, even in the pandemic. Because we didn\u2019t have to pay student loans, we have been able to save 20% to put down on a house. This is super important for us because, as a queer couple, we already have to anticipate thousands of more dollars to even start our family. As a male same-sex couple, the cost of adoption or surrogacy would be astronomical. We\u2019re moving into a house to be closer to our families to have kids and start a family, and not paying loans is helping us work toward that. I\u2019m white passing, but I was raised by my single Puerto Rican mom. We were set up worse than some of my other friends were, and then if you want to get ahead, you have to go to college. Most of my fellow Black and brown friends worked through college, unpaid internships, multiple jobs, and they carry most of the student debt. I didn\u2019t inherit any wealth. My grandfather just died and he didn\u2019t leave us any money, because he just didn\u2019t have any. When I tell other people how much student loan forgiveness would give my husband and I a more equal playing field, they ignore me and tell me education was my choice and my fault. But I look back \u2014 I worked while I was in school. I was on SNAP benefits during grad school. I applied for every scholarship I could find. It\u2019s frustrating because you feel like you\u2019re working against a system that says it\u2019s working for you but is working against you. It\u2019s frustrating that student loan forgiveness is used as a political tool, but there is never any progress made toward it in actuality. My husband and I are both public servants, so we're trying every day to make the community a better place, and we also want the opportunity to be happy in our own lives.",

The first person was 90-year-old British grandmother Margaret Keenan.\n\nShakespeare died Thursday, but the cause of death was not immediately known, according to the BBC. The Coventry resident had reportedly worked at Rolls Royce and served as a parish councilor for many years in the city\u2019s Allesley community.\n\nHe made international headlines after getting inoculated at University Hospital Coventry, a major milestone in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic.

        "234": "Sen. Elizabeth Warren, the Democrat from Massachusetts who has made a career trying to increase government oversight of the banking system, had some strong departing words for the Federal Reserve\u2019s top bank regulator, a Republican with more of a deregulatory bent.\n\nWarren criticized Fed Vice Chairman for Supervision Randal Quarles \u2014 who was appointed by former President Donald Trump, and whose four-year term is set to expire in October \u2014 during a Senate Banking Committee hearing.\n\n\u201c \u2018Our financial system will be safer when you are gone.\u2019 \u201d \u201cYour term as chair is up in five months and our financial system will be safer when you\u2019re gone.

Warren\u2019s comments came at the end of questioning when she argued the Fed should not have removed Credit Suisse CS, and a few major foreign entities from a program overseeing the biggest banks. This lack of scrutiny ultimately played a role in the Swiss banking giant suffering over $5 billion in losses from the collapse of Archegos Capital Management, Warren said. As the two officials talked over each other during the virtual hearing, Quarles denied Warren\u2019s allegation. \u201cWe did not weaken the supervision of a bank like Credit Suisse.

The company will prioritize states with zero-emissions regulations\u2014California, Connecticut, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New York, New Jersey, Oregon, Rhode Island, and Vermont\u2014but also Arizona, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Texas. If you don't live in one of those 16 states and you want an Ioniq 5, you'll have to wait until sometime in 2022 to buy one.\n\nWe still don't have pricing information\u2014expect that information closer to release. More details are also coming for a subscription option that sounds a lot like Volvo's Care by Volvo program, which includes insurance and maintenance in its monthly fee.\n\nAlthough other markets will get the Ioniq 5 with a choice of two different battery packs, the US will be limited to the larger pack, which has a capacity of 77.4 kWh. There is a choice of powertrains, however. A rear-wheel-drive version, which uses a single 225 hp (168 kW), 258 lb-ft (350 Nm) electric motor, will be available; Hyundai is targeting a range of 300 miles (482 km) with this model.\n\nHyundai will offer a dual-motor, all-wheel drive variant for those looking for a bit more acceleration and a bit less range. This option adds a 100 hp (74 kW) motor to the front axle, with a combined output of 320 hp (239 kW) and 446 lb-ft (605 Nm). How far this version can go on a full charge depends on whether the vehicle is in the SE or SEL trim, in which case that range should be 269 miles (433 km), or the more expensive Limited trim, which should have a range of 244 miles (393 km). (Presumably, this is because of some added weight from extra equipment, or perhaps less aerodynamic wheels.)\n\nAll Ioniq 5s will be limited to a top speed of 115 mph (185 km/h), and they can tow up to 1,500 lbs (680 kg).\n\nThe Ioniq 5 is essentially a big battery on wheels, and Hyundai has enabled a vehicle-to-load (V2L) function that allows the car to provide up to 1.9 kW of 120 V power. You can plug devices into a standard US-spec plug socket located at the base of the rear seats or externally with an adapter that connects to the car's charging port. For a good demonstration of how that works, I highly recommend a recent Jonny Smith video in which he tests a preproduction Ioniq 5 in the UK (I believe European- and UK-spec Ioniqs output 240 V, as that's the voltage over there):\n\nAs we noted last time we covered the Ioniq 5, Hyundai has designed some flexibility into the interior. The center console can move fore and aft; together with the flat floor, this means a driver can easily get in and out via the passenger-side door. The front seats recline and include a pop-out foot rest, although we're pretty sure the driver's seat can only recline when the Ioniq 5 is parked. The rear seats also recline and can slide forward and back.\n\nThe dash is dominated by a pair of 12-inch screens. One is the main instrument panel, which is supplemented by an augmented reality heads-up display. The second is a touchscreen display for the infotainment system. Hyundai says it is developing a \"hassle-free in-car payment system\" for the Ioniq 5 that will let you \"find and pay for EV charging,\" \"order and pay for food and coffee to go,\" and \"find, reserve, and pay for parking\" via the car. And all Ioniq 5s will come with Hyundai's Bluelink connected car services (useful if you drop your keys in a parking lot and someone steals the car) and will receive over-the-air updates for maps and multimedia software every April and October.",

        "237": "Small-Business Owners Are Scoring Dream Spots In The Most Cutthroat Market\n\nEli Sussman never imagined he would be able to open a restaurant at 30 Rock \u2014 the heart of Manhattan and the location of Tina Fey's sitcom by the same name.\n\nBut he's done it.\n\nHis Mediterranean fast casual restaurant Samesa opened in Rockefeller Center in March. Before then, Samesa was on a residential side street in Williamsburg, Brooklyn.\n\n\"It's about as night and day as you can get,\" Sussman says.\n\nUntil now, getting a spot in Midtown Manhattan was too expensive and competitive \u2014 Sussman would be typically bidding against big chains.\n\nBut new leases and lease renewals are down nearly 60% in Manhattan since the early days of the pandemic, opening up new locations, according to the real estate services firm CBRE.\n\nSamesa's Brooklyn location closed in September because of the pandemic. Sussman started eyeing new spaces with lots of foot traffic and office workers looking for a quick lunch.\n\nFor a fast casual restaurant such as Samesa, Midtown Manhattan is the ultimate dream location, he says.\n\nAnd as New York City takes big steps toward reopening, with many COVID-19 capacity limits and restrictions lifted as of May 19, some business owners are taking advantage of a less cutthroat real estate market to get their dream spaces.\n\nSussman is paying more in rent at Rockefeller Center than in Brooklyn but expects he'll get more customers.\n\nIt's a significant bet. Rockefeller Center is still quiet, and small-business owners such as Sussman need office workers and tourists to come back soon.\n\n\"The amount of people that are going to walk by Samesa is so much exponentially greater than what was at my previous location. So I'm playing a bit of a long game here,\" Sussman says.\n\nIn Manhattan's trendy Meatpacking District, Jesse Dong is also betting on the city's recovery. He owns the clothing retailer Two Minds. The store opened a few weeks ago.\n\nDong lost his retail job during the pandemic and started thinking about opening his own store. He was riding his bike and saw an available storefront on his dream street. It has cobblestones and is near luxury shops such as Herm\u00e8s and cultural attractions such as the Whitney Museum.\n\n\"We knew we had to move fast or it was going to slip through our fingers,\" he says.\n\nDong says it felt like if he waited to bid on the space, he'd be up against tenants with bigger names and more resources \u2014 so he signed a lease.\n\nHe says that puts him in a good position now that many COVID-19 restrictions have been lifted in New York.\n\nMike Slattery, associate director of research at CBRE, warns tenants against expecting a huge rent bargain. It's still Manhattan.\n\nHe says this is the time for tenants to make decisions on new spaces. Over the last six months, there's been a 22% increase in the number of tenants looking at spaces \u2014 and that number keeps rising.\n\n\"The flow of tenants back into the market has actually started to spark bidding wars,\" Slattery says.\n\nAll these small-business owners will be hoping for the same thing: a return to the way things used to be, with people on shopping sprees or on their way to a towering holiday tree.\n\n\"We're open,\" Dong says about his clothing store. \"And there seems to be a return to normalcy.\"",

As it has been one of the hottest stocks in the semiconductor space, let\u2019s take a look at its fundamentals ahead of the earnings release.\n\n\n\nNVIDIA has been rallying over the past three months, reaping gains of 13.8% and outperforming the industry average loss of 1.6%. This uptrend is likely to continue given the that the chipmaker has strong chances of beating estimates and saw positive earnings revisions, which are generally a precursor to an earnings beat, ahead of its Q1 report.\n\nNVIDIA currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and has an Earnings ESP of +1.94%. According to our methodology, the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they\u2019re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.\n\n\n\nThis videogame-gear specialist saw positive earnings estimate revision of a couple of cents over the past 30 days for the first quarter of fiscal 2022.

        "240": "That TSA handles pipeline security at all is an artifact of the post-Sept. 11, 2001, reorganization of the federal government. Originally, the Department of Transportation oversaw pipelines, which were seen as a mode of transportation \u2014 whether conveying fuel, gas or chemicals. Then in 2002, responsibility for pipeline security was moved to the newly created TSA, which was given statutory authority to secure surface transportation. DOT, however, still is in charge of safety of the actual pipes \u2014 or ensuring they do not fail.\n\n\u201cThis is a first step, and the department views it as a first step, and it will be followed by a much more robust directive that puts in place meaningful requirements that are meant to be durable and flexible as technology changes,\u201d said a senior DHS official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the directives have not been issued yet.\n\nOne challenge TSA will face as a regulator is a lack of trained staff to handle audits and enforcement. In 2014, its pipeline security division had dwindled to one staffer, and in 2019, officials testified, it still had only five. To rectify that, DHS is planning to have CISA, the department\u2019s cybersecurity agency, work with TSA to enforce the new rules, officials said. They are also planning to hire more staff: 16 at TSA and 100 at CISA.",
        "241": "The next-generation Tesla Roadster is one of the most hotly anticipated electric sports cars that may or may not ever make it to market. With a sub-two-second zero to 60 time, the Roadster is easily pushing the limits of just how fast street cars can rocket off the line. Obviously, that's going to attract a bit of competition. What we didn't expect is for that competition to come from an RC car. As Gizmodo brought to our attention, YouTuber Engineering After Hours set out to best the Roadster's acceleration sprint in a tiny, custom-built radio controlled toy. The lessons he learned proved to be extremely useful in understanding exactly why achieving such crazy acceleration with street cars can be so difficult. For starters, besting the Roadster's claimed time required drawing inspiration from a controversial F1 car.\n\nThe upcoming Tesla Roadster is said to sprint from zero to 60 miles per hour in just 1.9 seconds. That's a rather ambitious time, though thanks to the help of modern electric propulsion systems, it seems within the automaker's grasp\u2014whenever the car actually comes to market, that is. Meanwhile, Engineering After Hours set out to beat the time on a scaled version. A custom designed RC car is the heart of this particular experiment, which is all about beating the 1.9-second figure. But doing that in a tiny version of a car is a lot harder than you think, and its low weight only adds to the problem. As it turns out, keeping the car planted on the ground is pretty difficult. Even with all-wheel-drive and traction compound applied to the tires, the car had issues sticking to the pavement at takeoff. You might remember the classic clip of a Mercedes CLR piloted by Peter Dumbreck at the 1999 Le Mans doing a backflip\u2014well, the RC car was doing something similar because of its own aerodynamics and weight.\n\nTo solve the issue, the YouTuber drew inspiration from Gordon Murray, the same man who built the beloved McLaren F1. In the late '70s, Murray did some work for Brabham to help design a car that would beat the Lotus Type 78. The Brabham BT46B was born, affectionately earning the \"Fan Car\" nickname thanks to the large fan mounted at the rear of the vehicle which, on the books, was to help cool the horizontally-mounted radiator. A rather convenient side effect was that it created an immense reduction in air pressure underneath the car, which was close to the ground thanks to a set of low-hanging skirts. This technicality helped circumvent the ban on \"moveable aerodynamic devices\" and helped the car maintain phenomenal grip around the track. As you may have guessed by now, the RC car designed by the YouTuber uses very similar technology. Custom 3D-printed ducting houses two fans that suck air from underneath the car, effectively creating a vacuum that helps keep the tiny vehicle sucked to the ground. With the fans enabled, the roughly 7.9-pound RC car is able to generate around 19 pounds of downforce, a figure roughly 240 percent of the car's weight. The fans enabled the car to sustain 3Gs of acceleration and cornering force. With the fans off, the car struggled to maintain anything over 1G in both acceleration and cornering force. After some trial and error (and lot of carnage), the car's best zero to 60 run took an astounding 1.73 seconds, beating the Tesla Roadster's supposed 1.9-second mark. When adjusting the time for a one-foot rollout (as Tesla does when measuring this time) the calculations point to about 1.46 seconds. Despite the victory, the RC car did expose a fatal flaw that also forced Brabham to withdraw its fan car from the races. One of the biggest complaints by other drivers racing against the BT46B was that it would hurl rocks at cars behind it\u2014it was this reason that the Fan Car was voluntarily withdrawn before it could be banned. This complaint has been long debated over its validity; however, as demonstrated in the YouTube video, the RC car kicked enough rocks up to actually shatter the protective lens of the GoPro attached to its rear.",
        "242": "Deutsche Bank Macro strategist, Marion Laboure, joins Yahoo Finance to break down the volatility of cryptocurrency and what could be next for the cryptocurrency market as it continues to see ups and downs.\n\nJULIE HYMAN: There is a note recently that caught our eye from Deutsche Bank that talked about Bitcoin and some of the threats it may face on the regulatory front. Marion Laboure is joining us now. She's a Deutsche Bank macro strategist who wrote that note. And you talk about, you quote Karl Lagerfeld, which of course, caught my eye. Trendy is the last stage before tacky, you said, which basically illustrates the fickle nature of cryptocurrency trading. Do you think that the regulatory concerns are the biggest threat to a continued rally?\n\nMARION LABOURE: Yeah, so actually, the value of Bitcoin fell sharply last week to just above 30K at one point, so it lost more than half since it reached nearly 65K in mid-April. So if we look at the big picture, we are back to prices since two, three months ago. And let me start with your remarks. Overall, what we are seeing, it's clearly a rising trend. So in a year Bitcoin prices has risen by four or five times, so clearly bitcoins and sure not all cryptocurrency, are here to stay. And Bitcoin's market cap of $1 trillion makes it too important to ignore.\n\nSo I'm not saying that all crypto projects are serious, because we have seen DeFi100, and some jokes like Dogecoin. And what we are seeing in this market and what I clearly emphasize is its noted volatility. And we saw that there is less than a third of bitcoins that are used for transactional activity related to payments for goods and services. And the rest largely is used as a financial investment.\n\nSo liquidity is relatively low if we compare it to other assets and other currencies. So what we expect is probably like Bitcoin to remain volatile with a few additional large franchises or market it could significantly impact the supply and demand equilibrium. So this volatility is fairly normal and we should continue to expect it looking forward.\n\nBRIAN SOZZI: Marion, you write in your research that regulators will quote, \"crack down on Bitcoin.\" What is cracking down on Bitcoin look like?\n\nMARION LABOURE: So yes, currently it's slightly less, but Bitcoin's market cap reached $1 trillion, which makes it definitely too important to ignore. And we also believe that bitcoins and probably a few of our cryptocurrencies are here to stay. So until recently, regulators and authorities have been reluctant to move too fast into the cryptocurrency space, because there has been like a lot of innovation. And this allowed the financial sector to innovate as well. So competition and innovation are usually positively correlated.\n\nWhat I was saying, is like governments are probably unlikely to relinquish their monetary monopolies. And as bitcoins or any other private cryptocurrencies start to seriously compete with regular currencies and [INAUDIBLE] currencies, government currencies, regulators and policy makers will wake right up. And it's, we are already actually seeing that. If you look at what the Bank of International Settlements, the G7, the G20, they are all keeping a close eye on cryptocurrency. And regulation is definitely coming.\n\nSo the later part of this year and early next year, 2022, are going to be a turning point for cryptocurrencies, and this for around the world. Cryptocurrency regulators, they clearly have the topic on their agenda. So just to give you like actual example, in the Europe European Union, the European Commission did a market consultation earlier last year, and they all started MiFID II with a MiFIR, which is expected to take effect by the end of this year or early next year.\n\nIn the US, the US government has taken also numerous regulatory actions since early 2019, such as the framework for digital assets. And you may have seen as well that last week, cryptocurrency transfers of more than 10K now needs to be reported to US tax authorities. And we also expect the new Biden administration to establish a collaborative and unified strategy to address this existing comprehensive regulatory framework, and establish new regulations as needed to provide legal certainty. So we should have more and more regulation [INAUDIBLE] as well.\n\nMYLES UDLAND: Marion, I'm curious what kind of feedback you've gotten from clients on this piece. Are people, do they agree, do they disagree, are people wondering why you guys are spending time writing about Bitcoin? What has that feedback been like so far?\n\nMARION LABOURE: Yeah, I think there is a clear consensus that bitcoins, and it's true for bitcoins, but it's true for most of cryptocurrency, it's a very volatile investment. There is also consensus with clients that bitcoins-- and not only bitcoins, but like it's for [INAUDIBLE] and [INAUDIBLE] cryptocurrencies-- that they reach a certain market cap that is probably too high to be ignored.\n\nAnd I mean, most of them are thinking about cryptocurrency. Sure, clients are moving towards cryptocurrency. A few of them think that it could be a good hedge regarding inflation. And a few of them are thinking as well that maybe in the future we could see bitcoins as the new digital gold. This is what we had in terms of client's response.\n\nJULIE HYMAN: Right. So they're definitely interested and they're hungry for some fundamental analysis what one can do when it comes to cryptocurrencies. Marion, thank you so much for joining us. Marion Laboure is a Deutsche Bank macro strategist talking to us about cryptocurrencies and regulation and liquidity and all of the other issues surrounding it. Appreciate it.",
        "243": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 In March, US home prices jumped by the most in more than seven years as an increasing number of would-be buyers compete for a dwindling supply of houses.\n\nThe March S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller 20-city home price index, released Tuesday, rose 13.3 percent from a year earlier, the biggest gain since December 2013. That increase followed a surge of 12 percent in February.\n\nThe large gains suggest that the pandemic has spurred more Americans to seek out the extra room provided by a single-family home. Yet at the same time, COVID-19 has discouraged many homeowners from selling and opening up their homes to would-be buyers.\n\nAs a result, the number of homes for sale fell 21 percent in April compared with a year earlier, to just 1.16 million, near a record low on records dating back to 1982, according to the National Association of Realtors.\n\nThat has pushed buyers into a near-frenzy. Properties were on the market for just 17 days in April, and 88 percent of homes sold were on the market for less than a month, the NAR said.\n\nThe resulting bidding wars raised the price of the typical, or median, house to $341,600 last month, the NAR said, a record high.\n\nSome of the year-over-year gain likely reflects slower sales and reduced demand a year ago at the onset of the pandemic. All 20 cities in the Case-Shiller index reported faster price gains in March than in February.\n\nThe largest increase was in Phoenix for the 22d straight month, where prices rose 20 percent compared with a year ago. San Diego saw the next largest gain, at 19.1 percent, followed by Seattle, with 18.3 percent. Boston was fourth, with a 14.9 percent year-over-year increase. Prices here rose 2.6 percent from February to March.\n\nThe housing market has gotten so out of whack that nearly half of all homes are now selling for above the seller\u2019s asking price, according to real estate brokerage firm Redfin, the highest in the decade the company has tracked such data. That\u2019s up from roughly a quarter of sales in April 2019, the year before the pandemic.\n\nStill, the market may cool off in the coming months. With vaccinations spreading and COVID-19 waning, more sellers may be willing to list their homes.\n\nAnd Daryl Fairweather, chief economist at Redfin, said many Americans are likely to start spending more money on services, such as vacations, dining out, and other entertainment, and focus less on new homes.\n\nThe number of people signing contracts to buy homes dropped in May, and fewer people are applying for mortgages.\n\n\u201cAt a certain point, buyers just back off and you get more stable price growth,\u2019\u2019 Fairweather said. \u2018\u2018I think this is the peak, but it\u2019s going to be hot for a long time. It\u2019s more like a plateau.\u201d",

The address of the London agency that contacted me is fake. They never had a presence there, it's a laser surgery centre. All staff have weird LinkedIn profiles.\"\n\nThe profiles he found had now disappeared, but not before he noticed that \"everybody there has worked in Russia\".\n\nSami Ouladitto, a comedian with nearly 400,000 subscribers, reported a similar approach, as did Et Ca Se Dit Medecin (And They Call Themselves Doctors), a hospital intern with 84,000 followers on Instagram.\n\n\"This is pathetic, it's dangerous, it's irresponsible and it's not going to work,\" French Health Minister Olivier Veran told the BFMTV channel on Tuesday.\n\nFrench people are mostly in favour of getting vaccinated and \"I don't think that any attempt to turn them away from vaccines will work,\" he said, adding he had \"no idea\" whether the supposed offer might have originated in Russia.\n\nThe authors of the emails, claiming to be a London-based agency called Fazze, are difficult to trace, French media reported.\n\nLe Monde newspaper said Fazze had never been registered in the United Kingdom, but may have a legal presence in the Virgin Islands.\n\nBut according to the LinkedIn profile of Fazze's CEO, now deleted, the agency operates out of Moscow, Le Monde said.\n\nAccording to tweets by people claiming knowledge of the matter, the agency offered 2,000 euros ($2,450) to influencers in return for them claiming notably that the Pfizer-BioNTech jab caused more deaths than any other vaccine.\n\nThe vaccine, usually referred to in France as only Pfizer, has gained in popularity after a rival British-Swedish vaccine by AstraZeneca fell out of favour in much of the European Union because of health concerns and delivery delays.\n\nThe EU executive is suing AstraZeneca to force it to deliver 90 million more doses of its Covid-19 vaccine before July.\n\nThe legal action piles further pressure on the company after a link was made between its vaccine and very rare but often fatal blood clots coupled with low platelet levels.\n\nThe EU has also authorised two other vaccines for use, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson.\n\nBut Russia's Sputnik vaccine -- as well as China's Sinopharm -- are still not cleared for use in the bloc.\n\nAfter a sluggish start, France's coronavirus vaccination rollout has gained pace in recent weeks, with some 23 million people -- a third of the population -- receiving at least one dose so far.",

        "249": "When the novel coronavirus forced schools to shut down last March, Maegen Wagner, a single mother living near Reading, Pennsylvania, was thankful for at least one thing: She didn't need to worry about how she'd pay for internet service.\n\nSince her divorce in 2017, the 39-year-old mother of two children had been enrolled in Comcast's Internet Essentials program, which offers low-income families broadband access for only $9.95 per month. While money was already tight before the pandemic began, things got even worse for Wagner when she lost her assistant teaching job just as remote learning classes resumed in the fall.\n\nWagner applied for unemployment, but it took months before she began receiving checks.\n\n\"This whole pandemic has been a struggle, to be honest,\" she said. \"I don't know what we would have done if I also had to worry about a $100-a-month bill for internet service. There's no way I could have paid that.\"\n\nGoing to a public Wi-Fi hotspot at a library or community center wouldn't have been an option for her family, Wagner added, because her daughter, who has Down syndrome, also has health issues that put her at risk of serious complications from COVID-19.\n\n\"She's been hospitalized six times for pneumonia as a result of the common cold,\" Wagner said. \"I wasn't going to risk taking her to a public place for anything, so we would have been stuck without Internet Essentials.\"\n\nFor every Wagner family helped by a low-cost broadband plan, there are many others left hanging when it comes to broadband. The need has become especially obvious over the past year as the COVID-19 pandemic forced everything from family gatherings to classes and business meetings to go online. Federal and state governments have earmarked billions of dollars to build out fast internet service, but most plans don't address one of the biggest reasons people don't have broadband at home: They can't afford to pay for service.\n\nThere's no precise data on how many people don't have broadband because they can't pay for it. A 2020 Cost of Connectivity study by the New America Foundation's Open Technology Institute determined the US has the highest average monthly internet prices when compared to other countries in North America, Europe and Asia. And a Pew Research survey from April 2020 found that roughly half of Americans with lower incomes worried about paying their broadband and cellphone bills over the coming months. In early 2019, Pew said that 44% of adults with household incomes below $30,000 didn't have home broadband.\n\nIt's often Black, indigenous and other people of color who are hurt by the high prices of internet in the US. Lack of high-speed home internet access disproportionately affects children of color, according to a joint study last year from the Alliance for Excellent Education, National Indian Education Association, National Urban League and UnidosUS. And redlining -- the practice of refusing to give someone a loan or insurance because they live in an area considered to be financially risky -- has expanded to internet service.\n\n\"There are real affordability problems in the US,\" said Josh Stager, senior counsel at the Open Technology Institute, the tech arm of the New America Foundation think tank that pushes for policy and regulatory reforms. His group's report went so far as to call the situation an \"affordability crisis.\"\n\nThere is hope the situation may soon change. President Joe Biden, in his $2 trillion infrastructure plan unveiled last month, initially pledged $100 billion over eight years to make sure every American has broadband access. He said affordability would be a big part of that. And then in mid-May, the government introduced a $50 Emergency Broadband Benefit to get people online. Since the initial infrastructure proposal, Biden has cut his broadband proposal to $65 billion, which matches an amount that's been proposed by Republicans.\n\nIn the meantime, companies like Microsoft and Starry have been working to provide internet in poorer areas of the country, while local governments, nonprofits and various other organizations have found ways to make service more affordable.\n\n\"Once the pandemic started, it became painfully obvious that internet connectivity is a utility, and it's not just necessary to get through the pandemic but to get through modern life in America,\" Stager said. \"And the reality -- that so many people are struggling with affording the service, not access -- became undeniable.\"\n\nWhat's being done to solve the problem\n\nFor millions of Americans, the digital divide exists because they live in a rural part of the country where broadband infrastructure isn't available. Policy makers have tried for years to bridge the gap between the digital haves and have nots. Billions of dollars have been spent to build new infrastructure.\n\nA lower-profile -- but also sizable -- problem is that broadband service may be available but is simply unaffordable. When it comes to affordability, little has been done to address this issue in recent years, say critics.\n\n\"The Republicans under [President] Trump talked about solving both the broadband availability problem, as well as the adoption issue,\" said Blair Levin, author of President Barack Obama's 2010 National Broadband Plan and a former Federal Communications Commission official who served in the 1990s during President Clinton's term. \"But when you look at the actual record, almost all of the efforts and all of the money was designed to address the first issue and nothing was done to address the second.\"\n\nThen the pandemic hit, shedding a light on the inequities between people with and without access to high-speed internet. Students without internet service haven't been able to attend school. And adults who can't go into offices have been unable to work remotely.\n\n\"The pandemic shows the scope and scale of the need for affordability solutions,\" said Kathryn de Wit, who directs the broadband access initiative for the Pew Charitable Trust. \"The fact is some Americans just can't afford broadband connections even when they are available. And that's true of rural, urban and suburban communities.\"\n\nPolicy makers have reacted to address the crisis. States have used money allocated in the initial COVID stimulus bill passed last summer to get broadband infrastructure deployed and to help offset the cost of service.\n\nThen in December, Congress passed another COVID-19 relief package that specifically provided a direct benefit or subsidy to people unable to pay their broadband bills. The Emergency Broadband Benefit, or EBB, is supposed to help American families financially hit by the coronavirus pandemic. This temporary program, which launched earlier this month, is administered through the FCC and gives eligible households a $50-a-month subsidy ($75 a month if you live on tribal lands). It also provides a one-time $100 payment toward a device to connect to the internet. More than 900 broadband providers, including the nation's largest ones, such as AT&T, Comcast and Verizon, are participating in the program.\n\nOnce President Biden took office this year, Congress allocated an additional $7.17 billion as part of the $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan passed in March to reimburse schools and libraries participating in the FCC's E-Rate program that have provided students and teachers with devices to connect to the internet for remote learning. This includes equipment like Wi-Fi hotspots, modems, routers and laptops that schools and libraries can lend out to students and teachers outside of the classroom. While it's not a direct subsidy for home broadband service, the money could help some families, who otherwise couldn't afford service, get connected to the internet.\n\nThe FCC also still administers its Lifeline program, which is paid for through the government's Universal Service Fund to provide a direct subsidy for phone and broadband service directly to individuals who qualify due to low income. The Lifeline program launched under President Ronald Reagan.\n\nBut most people agree that the $9.25 subsidy alone isn't sufficient to cover the cost of broadband. The Open Tech Institute's July report on broadband affordability estimated that the subsidy covers only about 13% of the average monthly costs for fixed home internet service in the US. The FCC has also acknowledged that Lifeline is underused. It estimates that only 26% of eligible households participate in the program.\n\nTo subsidize or not to subsidize?\n\nIf the early days of the EBB program are any indication, there is big demand for a more substantial subsidy. In the first week of the program, more than 1 million households signed up, the FCC said Thursday.\n\n\"The high demand we've seen for the Emergency Broadband Benefit Program demonstrates what many of us already knew to be true -- too many families are struggling to get online, even in 2021,\" FCC acting chair Jessica Rosenworcel said in a statement.\n\nSome civil rights and consumer groups are joining with the broadband industry to push Congress to make the broadband subsidy permanent. Groups such as the National Urban League, American Association of People with Disabilities, the National Black Caucus of State Legislators are teaming up with broadband companies like AT&T, Comcast, Charter and Verizon in a coalition they're calling Broadband Equity for All to ask Congress to create a \"predictable, dependable, long-term broadband benefit program.\"\n\nBut long-time consumer advocate Gigi Sohn, who served as an adviser to former FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler, warned that policy makers should proceed with caution when it comes to making something like an EBB subsidy permanent.\n\n\"I agree a permanent subsidy is needed,\" she said. \"But it can't unjustly enrich companies or incentivize them to keep their prices high.\"\n\nShe also agrees that Congress needs to find a sustainable way to fund the subsidy.\n\n\"We can't require advocates for low-income individuals to come hat in hand to Congress every year for appropriations,\" she added.\n\nAt least one state, New York, is trying to mandate that service providers offer affordable service tiers for broadband to low-income individuals. In April, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo signed into law legislation that would force broadband providers in the state to offer a $15-a-month service to low-income customers.\n\nThe industry immediately pushed back, filing a lawsuit earlier this month in federal court seeking to block the law on the grounds that the state is overstepping its authority to interfere with broadband rates.\n\nThe law comes as most major internet service providers already offer their own low-income options for consumers.\n\nWhat the private sector is doing\n\nWhile the government has tried to bridge the digital divide, companies have offered their own programs to make internet more affordable. One of the biggest is Comcast's Internet Essentials program that connects low-income families like Wagner and her children. During the pandemic, Comcast expanded the $9.95 program and made it easier for people to qualify. After facing outcry about speeds too slow for students to attend at-home classes, Comcast boosted the internet speeds to 50Mbps down and 5Mbps up from 25Mbps down/3Mbps up pre-pandemic.\n\nOther ISPs offer their own low-cost programs for families that can't afford the higher, regular pricing. That includes the Access from AT&T program, the Spectrum Internet Assist offering and Verizon's Fios service that's discounted for people who participate in the government Lifeline program.\n\nFor some people, though, programs like Internet Essentials have too many barriers to be helpful. If a family has outstanding debt owed to Comcast within the past year, it wouldn't qualify for the program. Comcast has waived that requirement through June 30, but after that, it may become harder for people to sign up for service. And for other people who qualify financially but don't have digital literacy skills, the signup process can be confusing.\n\nAlternatives that seek to remove those barriers have popped up around the country. Some of those companies are partnering with Microsoft and its Airband program. Originally launched in 2017 to bring high-speed internet to rural communities using unlicensed TV wireless spectrum, Microsoft over the past year has expanded Airband to some cities by working with internet service providers and community organizations already in place. Instead of TV white space, they use fixed wireless, satellite and even fiber connections, depending on the location. And they all offer inexpensive -- or sometimes free -- internet for low-income subscribers.\n\n\"If you think about the digital divide \u2026 the first problem is getting access to areas that don't have any options,\" said Vickie Robinson, general manager of Microsoft's Airband Initiative. \"In urban centers, it's a different problem. Oftentimes there [is] at least one existing option for broadband access, but it's not accessible ... because of affordability challenges.\"\n\nIn LA, Microsoft has partnered with low-cost internet provider Starry and the Housing Authority for the City of Los Angeles to provide internet service to people living in the city's affordable housing communities. Through the program that launched last year, residents get six months free of 30Mbps down/30Mbps up service through the company's Starry Connect digital equity program. The service costs $15 a month afterward.\n\nInstead of tying service to an individual -- which traditionally has required ISPs to perform credit and background checks -- Starry provides service based on an address. If someone lives in one of LA's public housing apartments, that unit and whoever resides there can get Starry service. The six free months is only for residents during the initial launch period.\n\nThe $15 monthly service price includes all equipment, installation, 24/7 customer support, no data caps, no long-term contracts and no extra fees. Within LA, there are now 1,000 households connected through Starry Connect, and the company is still working to roll out service in additional public housing communities. Since Starry Connect first launched with the Boston Housing Authority in 2018, the program now covers more than 30,000 units of public and affordable housing in the US.\n\nProviding affordable internet is Starry's core mission, and most of its customers pay $50 a month for 200Mbps symmetrical speeds. Those plans help subsidize the Starry Connect $15 monthly rate, as does what it calls the \"special sauce\" of its \"technology efficiency.\" By using fixed wireless to provide service, Starry says its network is less expensive to run than building fiber directly to a home -- but it's still pricey to install the wired connection to each apartment unit in a building. To fund \"the last 10 feet\" of its network buildout, the company relies on grants from partners like Microsoft. Offering Starry Connect in a facility doesn't cost the public housing operators anything.\n\nWhere the Housing Authority in LA comes in is helping make residents aware of the service -- and giving Starry permission to operate in the facilities and use its buildings for its equipment. When signing up for service, a resident in public housing sees Starry Connect listed as an option. Many people likely don't even know they're on an affordable internet program, said Virginia Lam Abrams, Starry's senior vice president of government affairs and strategic advancement. The company designed the process that way on purpose. It reduces the friction in getting people to sign up for service and preserves the dignity of the subscribers, she said.\n\n\"When you have to kind of ask somebody to reaffirm three different ways that they are poor enough to deserve access to service, it really is just a terrible, kind of soul-crushing experience,\" Lam Abrams said. \"By removing the whole prove-to-me-that-you're-poor threshold, I think you bring a lot more people to the door [who] are willing to say 'yes, I'm going to sign up for the service.'\"\n\nAs Microsoft and Starry have shown, private industry working alone often isn't enough to truly provide affordable internet. The program would have much more difficulty getting started -- and being accepted by users -- had the companies not worked with the Housing Authority in LA.\n\nBefore Starry, \"most of our sites were not really covered by anyone,\" said Jenny Scanlin, chief development officer for LA's Housing Authority. While $15 may seem reasonable to some residents, it's still too pricey for others who have no source of income. Scanlin hopes that the US Department of Housing and Urban Development will one day allow HACLA and others to cover the cost of internet service for public housing residents who can't afford it.\n\n\"If it's something that their children need and they need, [residents] will find the money for it,\" she said. \"But it's not going to be easy.\"\n\nTrashonda Brown, a lifetime resident at the HACLA Nickerson Gardens, is one of Starry Connect's new subscribers. Before Starry installed service at the public housing complex, the 39-year-old and her 20-year-old daughter relied on their phones for connectivity. None of the major internet service providers offered connections in Nickerson Gardens' 1,066 apartments. And even if they served the units, it's likely many people couldn't have afforded the monthly fees.\n\n\"Where we're living at, we're basically in poverty,\" Brown said. \"If [Starry Connect's internet service] could be $9, I'd take that, but it's better than $50.\"\n\nAs for Wagner, the Pennsylvania single mother, she said that without Comcast's low-cost broadband service, she would have been forced to make difficult decisions for her family during the pandemic.\n\n\"If I would have had to pay the full cost of internet, I would've had to choose between keeping my kids online for school or buying essentials, like shampoo or soap,\" Wagner said.",

        "251": "Elon Musk wreaked havoc in the crypto markets on May 13 after announcing that Tesla would be halting all BTC payments until the cryptocurrency\u2019s mining becomes more environmentally sustainable.\n\nMusk posited that while Tesla awaits bitcoin\u2019s transition to renewable energy, the electric car maker would be exploring other cryptocurrencies that use less than 1% of bitcoin\u2019s energy per transaction.\n\nHis tweet sent the crypto Twitter community into a frenzy of speculation as to which cryptocurrency Tesla could be looking into for Tesla to accept payments in. Notably, several cryptocurrencies have been trying to attract the attention of Musk without any success.\n\nIn a May 25 tweet, the South African-born centibillionaire elaborated why Dogecoin remains his favourite coin. According to Musk, cryptocurrencies like ethereum ETH), Solano (SOL), Cardano (ADA), Polkadot (DOT) don\u2019t have dogs and memes like Dogecoin.\n\nDogecoin (DOGE) is widely known for its parabolic rise this year in the wake of Elon Musk\u2019s repeated mentions of the canine-themed coin on social media. Musk recently indicated that he is working with Dogecoin developers to \u201cimprove system transaction efficiency\u201d.\n\nMusk\u2019s comments on Dogecoin have become controversial. Some observers believe that his tweets steal the spotlight from deserving cryptos with real raison d\u2019etre and development going on, while others deem it as outright market manipulation.\n\nEthereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin also recently criticized Musk\u2019s plan to scale Doge 10x and reduce the cost of using the blockchain by 100X. In an article on Sunday titled \u201cThe Limits to Blockchain Scalability\u201d, Buterin argued that it is incredibly difficult to significantly increase a crypto\u2019s scalability and throughput \u201cwithout leading to extreme centralization and compromising the fundamental properties that make a blockchain what it is.\u201d\n\nNonetheless, Musk remains steadfast in his support of Dogecoin. In a tweet yesterday, he urged his followers to submit their development proposals on GitHub and Reddit.",
        "252": "Often called the \u201cEthereum oracle,\u201d DARMA Capital\u2019s Andrew Keys sat down with CoinDesk during Consensus 2021 for a brief interview covering his prediction rate for this year so far, and what\u2019s next for ETH and DeFi now that everything seems to have hit its stride.\n\nWhat do you make of the second all-virtual Consensus? Is this a format you would hope to see continue even as the world returns to normal? Any thoughts on the metaverse replacing real life?\n\nCall me old-fashioned, but I miss the human connection and look forward to attending in person next year. That said, it\u2019s great that people have the ability to access the subject matter expertise that comes to Consensus, from anywhere in the world.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of talk about ETH being \u201cultra-sound money.\u201d Is this an idea you buy into \u2013 or is it just wishful thinking?\n\nI absolutely agree with this concept. Ether is an asset unlike the world has ever seen. It has three core properties that make it valuable as:\n\u2022 None A capital asset: Owners of ETH own a piece of fees of world\u2019s global settlement layer.\n\u2022 None A consumable asset: ETH is a fuel, a digital commodity. For every computational step in Ethereum, a certain amount of ETH is \u201cburnt.\u201d\n\u2022 None A storage of value asset: ETH can be freely traded or used as collateral to borrow against in digital economy.\n\nTwo imminent catalysts to increasing the value of Ethereum include EIP 1559, wherein ether is burnt for every computational and storage transaction; and Transition to PoS, which reduces \u201csell pressure\u201d associated with proof-of-work mining costs like electricity, hardware and real estate. Most miners have to sell 75% of what they mine to pay these monthly expenses.\n\nRelated: China\u2019s BSN Builder Urges Developers to Look Beyond Cryptocurrency\n\nThere\u2019s a growing narrative that traditional finance folks understand Ethereum more than Bitcoin. Is this a replay of the \u201cblockchain, not bitcoin\u201d debates of the past?\n\nBitcoin addresses one simple use case. It\u2019s digital gold with a total addressable market (TAM) of $10 trillion. With bitcoin, Alice can send Bob value peer-to-peer and it\u2019s provably scarce. This is a non-trivial use case, and Bitcoin has been the patriarch of blockchain, but there\u2019s much more we can do with next-generation blockchain databases.\n\nEthereum is the substrate to the digital economy. Its TAM is $270 trillion, for its total economy. Ethereum can digitize all assets (commodities, fiat, stocks, derivatives, insurance policies and prescriptions) as well as financial instruments (loans, derivatives and exchanges) and legal agreements (employment, syndication, purchase orders and investments).\n\nWe\u2019re witnessing the birth of the digital economy. Ethereum is the only blockchain on Earth capable of being the substrate of the digital economy. Ether is an asset unlike any asset we\u2019ve ever seen before. We invest in ether and the picks and shovels around Ethereum (like layer 2 scaling solutions) to help increase adoption.\n\nYou called Coinbase the AOL of Web 3.0. What\u2019s next?\n\nDecentralized exchanges are growing rapidly, but there\u2019s a genuine concern that they\u2019re little more than ways to financialize token products. When will DEXs be able to support actual capital deployment and influence things in the physical world?\n\n[Decentralized finance] has over $100 billion in [total value locked] with Ethereum settling $1.5 trillion of transactions in Q1 \u201821 \u2026 actual capital deployment is happening right now. Last month, [European Investment Bank], [Goldman Sachs] and [Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale] had to spend ether in order to issue a bond. Those entities needed ether for operating expenses. It\u2019s happening right now.\n\nYou\u2019re known for your yearly Ethereum predictions. Have any been proven true so far?\n\nI\u2019ll defer to the fact-checkers, but in my view all of them have come true to some extent. One that I\u2019m particularly proud of is 2021 being a breakthrough year for layer 2 solutions. What we\u2019re seeing across the layer 2 landscape right now \u2013 particularly advancements in finality and security \u2013 makes me more confident than ever in the commercial viability of blockchain-based applications.\n\nAny predictions for when ETH 2.0 will go live?\n\u2022 None China\u2019s CBDC Could Give Beijing \u2018Leeway for Economic Retaliation,\u2019 Says National Security Expert",
        "253": "Hong Kong warned Tuesday it may soon have to throw away coronavirus vaccine doses because they are approaching their expiry date and not enough people have signed up for the jabs.\n\nHong Kong is one of the few places in the world fortunate enough to have secured more than enough doses to inoculate its entire population of 7.5 million people.\n\nBut swirling distrust of the government as it stamps out dissent -- combined with online misinformation and a lack of urgency in the comparatively virus-free city -- has led to entrenched vaccine hesitancy and a dismal inoculation drive.\n\nOn Tuesday a member of the government's vaccine task force warned that Hong Kongers \"only have a three-month window\" before the city's first batch of Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines go out of date.\n\n\"The vaccines all have expiry dates,\" Thomas Tsang, a former controller of the Centre for Health Protection, told RTHK radio.\n\n\"They cannot be used after the expiry date and the community vaccination centres for BioNTech will, according to present plans, cease operating after September.\"\n\nTsang said it was \"just not right\" that Hong Kong was sitting on an unused pile of doses while the rest of the world \"is scrambling for vaccines\".\n\nAnd he warned new doses were unlikely to be delivered.\n\n\"What we have is probably all we have for the rest of the year,\" he said.\n\nHong Kong bought 7.5 million doses each of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine and China's Sinovac.\n\nThe latter has yet to be approved by the World Health Organization but was fast-tracked for use by city health regulators.\n\nIt also pre-ordered 7.5 million doses of AstraZeneca jabs but scrapped that deal earlier in the year, with authorities saying they planned to use the money for second-generation vaccines next year.\n\nSo far just 19 percent of the population has received one dose of either vaccine, while 14 percent has received two doses.\n\nHesitancy is common even among the city's medical workers. Earlier this month, the city's Hospital Authority revealed only a third of its staff had taken the opportunity to be vaccinated.\n\nOn Tuesday, authorities announced the first major expansion of the vaccine programme to non-residents. Some 40,000 Chinese mainlanders with travel permits as well as some 13,000 refugee claimants will now be eligible.\n\nThere are currently hundreds of thousands of unused Pfizer-BioNTech shots, which must be stored at ultra-low temperatures and have a six-month shelf life.\n\nA total of 3,263,000 doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines have been shipped to Hong Kong at different stages so far but only 1,231,600 have been administered.\n\nAround 1 million doses were also put to one side after packaging problems and it is not clear how many were replaced by suppliers.\n\nSome two million Sinovac doses have been delivered but they have a longer shelf-life of a year.\n\nHong Kong's vaccine hesitancy comes as many nearby countries are scrambling to secure enough doses as the coronavirus wreaks havoc.\n\nIn recent weeks, some Hong Kong politicians have suggested the city could look to send unused vaccines overseas if take-up does not improve.\n\nPublic trust in the Hong Kong government has been at historic lows since Beijing and local authorities cracked down on dissent to end huge and often violent democracy protests that broke out in 2019.\n\nOfficials have also struggled to come up with incentives to encourage vaccination in a city where long quarantine measures and economically painful social distancing rules have kept infections low.\n\nInstead officials have largely put the onus on businesses to push employees into vaccinating.\n\nEarlier this year the government announced HK$5,000 ($640) spending vouchers for all residents as a way to boost the economy.\n\nSome critics suggested the government should either link those vouchers to vaccination certificates -- or provide further cash handouts for the inoculated.\n\nHowever on Tuesday city leader Carrie Lam rejected that suggestion.\n\n\"To offer cash or something physical to encourage vaccination shouldn't be done by the government and may even cause the opposite effect,\" she said.",
        "254": "The mission of the Disruptor 50 list has always been to identify fast-growing, innovative start-ups on the path to becoming the next generation of great public companies. But in 2020, things got ridiculous. Twelve of the 50 companies named to the 2020 Disruptor 50 are now public companies. Four more have announced deals to become public via mergers with special purpose acquisition companies. All those exits meant the competition for the 2021 Disruptor 50 was as wide open as ever, and for the fifth straight year, a record number of start-ups (1,565 to be exact) jumped at the chance to make our annual list.\n\nAll private, independently owned start-up companies founded after Jan. 1, 2006, were eligible to be nominated for the Disruptor 50 list. Companies nominated were required to submit a detailed analysis, including key quantitative and qualitative information. Quantitative metrics included company-submitted data on workforce size and diversity, scalability, and sales and user growth. Some of this information has been kept off the record and was used for scoring purposes only. CNBC also brought in data from a pair of outside partners \u2014 PitchBook, which provided data on fundraising, implied valuations and investor quality; and IBISWorld, whose database of industry reports we used to compare the companies based on the industries they are attempting to disrupt. This year, for the first time, we added a separate Board Diversity category to be considered in addition to the existing Workforce Diversity category. We added this category as one of several steps to bring more diversity to the list overall. In addition to adding the Board Diversity category, we expanded our outreach to more companies with female founders and founders of color and their investors during our call for nominations.\n\nCNBC's Disruptor 50 Advisory Council \u2014 a group of 47 leading thinkers in the field of innovation and entrepreneurship from around the world (see list of members below) \u2014 then ranked the quantitative criteria by importance and ability to disrupt established industries and public companies. This year the council found that scalability and user growth were the most important criteria, along with use of breakthrough technologies (including, most commonly, artificial intelligence and machine learning) and size of the industry being disrupted. These categories received the highest weighting, but the ranking model is designed to ensure that companies must score highly on a wide range of criteria to make the final list. Companies were also asked to submit important qualitative information, including descriptions of their core business model, ideal customers and recent company milestones. A team of more than 70 CNBC editorial staff, along with members of the Advisory Council, read the submissions and provided holistic qualitative assessments of each company. The qualitative scores were combined with a weighted quantitative score to determine which 50 companies made the list and in what order.\n\nThe 2021 Disruptor 50 includes 24 companies making the list for the first time. They represent innovation in a wide range of sectors, including cybersecurity, fintech, health care, and electric vehicles. Many are driven by social or environmental missions, from democratizing access to financial services to strengthening the global food supply and fighting climate change. We expect all 50 will continue to grow, innovate and inspire change in their larger, incumbent competitors as we follow them through the rest of this year and into the next. Many, we expect, will become perennial Disruptor 50 companies. This year, six Disruptors have made the list for the fourth time. The No. 1 Disruptor, Robinhood, has made the list for the fifth and final time, with its public debut expected in just a few weeks. At No. 2, Stripe is a seven-time Disruptor 50 company, only the third company in the history of the list with that distinction.

The CEO says that miners have \u201ccommitted to publish current & planned renewable usage\u201d and are urging other miners across the globe to do the same.

        "257": "President Joe Biden on Monday signed legislation that will allow large cruise ships to travel to Alaska this summer. The first voyages under the new Alaska Tourism Restoration Act are scheduled for late July.\n\nFederal law prevents large cruise ships from traveling between the Lower 48 and Alaska without a stop in Canada, but that nation has blocked most cruise travel until February 2022.\n\nThe Alaska Tourism Restoration Act temporarily waives the requirement that those Alaska-bound ships stop in Canada. Small ships were not affected by the Canadian action.\n\nThe president\u2019s press secretary, Jen Psaki, called the signing \u201ca critical step to returning to normal in a state where one in 10 jobs is in the tourism industry.\u201d\n\nShortly before the bill was signed, Royal Caribbean Cruise Lines announced that it will send two ships to Alaska this year. Combined with previously announced voyages from other cruise lines, that means at least six large ships will come to Alaska on weekly visits later this summer.\n\nMore than 1.2 million tourists visited Alaska by cruise ship in 2019. Last year, during the COVID-19 pandemic, just 48 passengers came to the state, according to Rain Coast Data, a Juneau economics firm.\n\nThe six ships coming to Alaska later this summer have a combined average capacity of 3,200 passengers. If each were to sail for eight weeks on average at full capacity, that\u2019s the potential for 153,600 cruise tourists.\n\nBut it isn\u2019t clear how much demand there will be for cruise travel. Cruise ships were a focus of the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the cruise lines are now marketing Alaska voyages on short notice.\n\nAll of the large cruise lines coming to Alaska are requiring passengers and crew to be vaccinated against COVID-19, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are imposing further restrictions.\n\nJuneau, Skagway and Hoonah, three of the state\u2019s major cruise ship ports, all have first-dose vaccination rates at or above 70%. Ketchikan, another major port, is experiencing its worst COVID-19 outbreak of the pandemic.\n\nAll three members of Alaska\u2019s Congressional delegation pushed the legislation through Congress this year with bipartisan support from elected officials in Alaska. Bipartisan agreement was also needed in Congress.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s fair to say that with a lot of persistence, a lot of diligence, we \u2014 the delegation \u2014 pulled this off, so this is a good, good day for Alaska,\u201d said Sen.

        "260": "It took Neil Armstrong more than three days just to reach the moon and when he later described his experience, he said, \u201cOne small step for [a] man, one giant leap for mankind.\u201d Evidently, the Doge community on earth has been talking about going \u201cto the moon\u201d for quite some time now.\n\nChalking out their path on a recent podcast, author and Bitcoin advocate Andreas Antonopoulos said,\n\nThe price of Dogecoin lately has predominantly revolved around the community\u2019s one-man army \u2013 Elon Musk. In fact, the same gets triggered every time the Tesla CEO tweets something about it. What\u2019s even more surprising is the fact that the community has started developing constructive arguments to justify how the meme-coin\u2019s price is actually sustainable.\n\nA section of Dogecoin hodlers believes that Musk is a strong proponent of Universal Basic Income (UBI) and intends to help the poor. However, the problem with that is the distribution. DOGE is concentrated in the hands of a few large hodlers, yet there is one \u201cinsane whale\u201d that keeps buying the coin in increments of 420 and 69, irrespective of the price.\n\nElaborating on the community\u2019s \u201cconspiracy theory\u201d further, the founder of Let\u2019s Talk Bitcoin Adam Levine questioned,\n\nCalling this the most direct and targeted method, many in the community believe that their \u201cDogefather\u201d is merely trying to sustain the price of the coin. A compelling argument, isn\u2019t it?\n\nLudicrously commenting on why Musk might be doing so, Antonopoulos added,\n\nAnother narrative being propounded by the alt\u2019s investors states,\n\nA few from the crypto-community believe that fiat currencies might cease to exist after a point in time and all transactions would take place using digital assets. Responding to what would be a greater scam hundred years down the line, Levine frivolously endorsed the community\u2019s perspective and said,\n\nTo the same, Antonopoulos responded, \u201cThe memes are better!\u201d\n\nBringing in another argument, Jonathan Mohan, the other host, viewed Dogecoin as a cross-section between a collectible that presented itself as a currency. Under such a lens, he prompted, DOGE would be the most liquid commoditized art project, with Mohan adding that DOGE was \u201cbooming\u201d just like how collectibles and art projects were.\n\nOn the question of why DOGE is the \u201cobvious\u201d choice for some, Levine said,\n\nAntonopoulos, for one, went on to admit his inclinations towards DOGE because of its meme and joke culture initially. Of late, however, it has had \u201cnegative fundamentals.\u201d In his concluding remarks, he said,",

        "263": "Peloton has announced plans to invest $400 million in a US factory to produce its connected bikes and treadmills, located in Troy Township, Ohio \u2014 about half an hour south of Toledo. The facility, which is planned to be approximately a million square feet, is called the Peloton Output Park. Peloton hopes it will eventually lead to lower prices for its products, though its CEO John Foley admits that could take a few years to happen.\n\nCurrently, Peloton mainly manufactures its fitness equipment in Taiwan, while many of its customers are in the US. This caused expensive shipping delays earlier this year as the company ran into both heightened demand and long shipping times resulting from the pandemic. The company\u2019s factory announcement is also colored by the shadow of its safety struggles and subsequent recall of its treadmill, as well as a potential data leak.\n\nUS-based manufacturing ventures are a reliable way for tech companies to generate positive press, and they can sometimes struggle to live up to the hype. Recent examples include Foxconn\u2019s infamous plant in Wisconsin and the \u201cnew\u201d \u201cApple\u201d factory, which then-president Donald Trump bragged about, that was neither new, nor operated by Apple. For its part, Peloton is promising 2,000 new jobs coming to a reasonably rural area, but the proof will be in the actual Pelotons rolling out from the Ohio factory, which the company says is planned for 2023. According to its announcement post, the company is currently working with local and state partners to finalize plans.\n\nThe Ohio factory may not be the first producing Peloton equipment in the US: the company purchased fitness equipment maker Precor late last year, which has factories in Washington and North Carolina. Peloton reportedly hopes to start building some equipment in those factories by the end of this year.",
        "264": "This week marks one year since David Adler Staveley faked his suicide before going on the run from the law for almost two months after he and a co-conspirator were the first in the nation to be charged with fraud in the Paycheck Protection Program in May 2020.\n\nLast week, Staveley pleaded guilty in a federal court in Rhode Island to conspiracy to commit bank fraud and failure to appear in court.\n\nAlso last week, federal prosecutors in California and Texas secured convictions in PPP fraud cases where defendants tried to bilk taxpayers out of millions in forgivable loans meant to save jobs and keep businesses afloat during the COVID-19 pandemic. The major convictions within a span of two days underscore how the Justice Department is cracking down on fraud cases from COVID-19 relief.\n\nIn May alone, federal prosecutors brought charges in separate in New Jersey, one in , a separate case, one in and one in . In these cases, defendants are still presumed innocent.\n\nAlso in early May, an man pleaded guilty to false statements to a financial institution in attempting to get a $300,000 PPP loan.\n\nThe Justice Department has charged more than with fraud related to PPP loans. Some cases are substantial. For example, in March, a pleaded guilty to a scheme applying for 15 different PPP loans using 11 different companies to get $24.8 million. In a pending case in California, federal prosecutors charged eight defendants with seeking more than 100 loans totaling almost using stolen identities and fake companies.\n\nBut the very first PPP fraud case closed last week.\n\nFORMER GEORGIA MAYORAL CANDIDATE USED $323G PPP LOAN ON SWIMMING POOL, FURNITURE, DOJ SAYS\n\nStaveley, 54, of Andover, Mass., to conspiring with David Andrew Butziger, 53, of Warwick, R.I., to file fraudulent PPP loan applications at a Rhode Island bank, according to the U.S. Attorney\u2019s office for the District of Rhode Island. Butziger pleaded guilty last September to conspiracy to commit bank fraud and is scheduled to be sentenced in late June.\n\nStaveley filed PPP loan applications for more than $500,000 purportedly to meet payroll for four separate businesses. However, two of those businesses were already closed and he didn\u2019t own the other two, thus had no wages to pay, according to the Justice Department.\n\nIn an unusual twist, three weeks after being released to home detention, Staveley \u2013 who had a June 2 court date \u2013 managed to remove his electronic monitoring device. He then left a suicide note in his car, which was located by the ocean in Massachusetts, unlocked and with his wallet inside, according to the Justice Department.\n\nAfter staging his suicide, Staveley traveled to various states and used false identities and stolen license plates from May 26 until the U.S. Marshals Service captured him on July 23 in Alpharetta, Ga., according to prosecutors.\n\nThe Small Business Administration\u2019s Paycheck Protection Program was part of the first COVID-19 relief measure, known as the CARES Act, for Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security. The program allowed qualifying businesses to receive forgivable or low-interest loans to meet payroll costs and was intended to reduce job losses during an economic emergency. In March 2020, Congress and then-President Trump made $349 billion in forgivable loans available to small businesses in the CARES Act. In April 2020, Congress authorized more than $300 billion for additional PPP funding and then another $284 billion in December 2020.\n\nFahad Shah, 44, of Murphy, Texas, got $1.5 million in PPP loans after claiming his company, WBF Weddings by Farah, employed 126 people with an average monthly payroll of $700,000. It was a bit of an exaggeration for a company with two employees, according to the U.S. Attorney\u2019s office for the Eastern District of Texas.\n\nShah admitted to using more than $1 million from the federal loan to pay off his home mortgage, buy securities in his personal investment account and buy two Teslas, two Freightliner trucks and a Mercedes Benz van, according to the Justice Department. He pleaded guilty last Wednesday to filing fraudulent loan applications and for submitting a fraudulent employer\u2019s information with the Internal Revenue Service.\n\n\"PPP loans were intended to help businesses keep themselves and their employees afloat during the COVID-19 pandemic,\" acting U.S. Attorney Nicholas J. Ganjei after Shah\u2019s guilty plea.\n\n\"PPP loans were not, and never were, intended to serve as personal loans for personal use. By applying and qualifying for PPP funds on fraudulent grounds, Fahad Shah took advantage of the COVID-19 economic crisis to enrich himself and his family,\" Ganjei continued. \"By seeking a loan that he should not have received, Shah helped to deplete the amount of funds available to all potential legitimate borrowers who really needed financial support.\"\n\nThe same day Shah pleaded guilty in Texas, two California brothers \u2013 Caesar Oskan, 66, of San Rafael, and Ester Ozkar, 66, of Novato, pleaded guilty in federal court in San Francisco to making false statements to a financial institution in separate schemes, according to the Justice Department.\n\nThe two brothers admitted that between March 2020 and June 2020 they each submitted multiple separate fraudulent applications for Economic Injury Disaster Loans, or EIDL, and PPP loans to defraud the Small Business Administration and the banks handling the PPP loans.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nCaesar Oskan admitted that he obtained $1 million in PPP loans and $713,500 in EIDL loans and advances after submitting 27 fraudulent applications, according to the Justice Department. Ester Ozkar admitted he obtained $474,132 in fraudulent PPP loans and $9,000 in EIDL advances after submitting eight fraudulent loan applications on behalf of six separate entities.\n\n\"Pandemic relief funds are limited and intended to save legitimate struggling businesses from failing,\" Acting U.S. Attorney Stephanie M. Hinds for the Northern District of California said in a statement. \"Individuals, like these two brothers, who treat these pools of relief funds as their personal bank accounts deserve to be vigorously prosecuted.\"",
        "265": "vaccine boosters Maybe the next phase in the nation's fight to contain covid 19 though it's still unclear if they're needed or how long the protection from a covid 19 vaccine regiment lasts. Researchers and health officials suspect it may wane. After a year or more, both the Pfizer and Moderna Ceos have come out and said that they believe booster shots are going to be needed within about 8 to 12 months from your first dose. Because of the data that they're seeing now, we can only assume that means because of the immunity that they're following from people who were in their clinical trials. But they haven't released that data just yet. The CDC maintains the need for and timing of a possible booster hasn't been established yet. What is widely known is that vaccination rates continue climbing at a stubbornly slow rate. Daily numbers down nearly 50% since its peak last month. According to the CDC in California. Lower demand means residents will notice fewer mass vaccination sites like the one that operated out of Dodger stadium will instead see smaller pop up locations like this one at Hollywood's pantages theatre. Now that we vaccinated, a significant portion of our population were left with a residual group that aren't all necessarily opposed to vaccination, but they're not quite as motivated to be vaccinated. Not going away here. A shot in the arm will get people a shot to see the musical Hamilton from a chance to get the hottest tickets in town. To the possibility of winning million dollar jackpots states all over the country are hoping to make it harder for people to pass on a shot. And if you're among the nearly 39% of Americans now fully vaccinated, this Chicago restaurant owner welcomes you to the other side, you're free to come and decide to go to the bar stand by, but you can actually be pre pandemic, no social distancing and no plexiglass dividers needed in the vaccinated, only section of Sam Sanchez's establishment. The city says it's okay for Chicago businesses to operate with no restrictions, so long as customers are vaccinated as we keep doing this, I think it's a great thing and I think again, the CDC has shown that the science shows if you're vaccinated, you're protected and later tonight, 15,000 people will fill new york's Madison square Garden to watch in person as the knicks face off against the Atlanta hawks, organizers say it will be the largest indoor event in new york state since the start of the pandemic.\n\nAs the COVID-19 vaccine rollout continues in the United States, with people ages 12 and older receiving their shots, vaccine makers are now preparing for a next possible phase: booster doses.Currently three coronavirus vaccines are authorized for emergency use in the United States \u2014 the two-dose Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine for ages 12 and older, the two-dose Moderna vaccine for ages 18 and older and the single-dose Johnson & Johnson vaccines for ages 18 and older.Researchers and health officials suspect that the immunity against COVID-19 these vaccines elicit in the body might wane over long periods of time \u2014 say, possibly, after a year or more \u2014 and might not protect as well against coronavirus variants that could emerge and evolve.Therefore, a vaccinated person might need a booster dose of vaccine to stay protected against the original coronavirus strain and newly emerging variants \u2014 somewhat similar to how a tetanus booster is recommended every 10 years or different flu vaccines are recommended each year.Will booster doses or new vaccines be needed?\"Many people may be familiar with tetanus-toxoid vaccines that are recommended every 10 years \u2014 that's a booster dose. It's reminding our immune system so that if we ever got exposed to that toxin, our immune system would remember it and respond very quickly,\" Dr. William Moss, professor and executive director of the International Vaccine Access Center at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, told CNN on Friday.In the case of COVID-19 vaccines it remains unknown for how long immune protection lasts, but vaccine developers and health officials know it may not be forever \u2014 and that emerging variants could escape immunity.\"There is a little nuance with COVID-19 vaccines,\" Moss said.While typical booster doses use same vaccine someone previously received to remind the immune system about immunity to a pathogen, any future boosters for the COVID-19 shot could use different vaccines altogether.Currently, \"the need for and timing for COVID-19 booster doses have not been established. No additional doses are recommended at this time,\" the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention notes on its website.But Americans should prepare to have a COVID-19 vaccine booster shot within a year, U.S. Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy told CNN's Wolf Blitzer on Thursday.\"We have to see how long the protection lasts. We know it lasts at least six months, but we'll have to see,\" Murthy said. \"It's very possible, though, and people should be prepared for the fact that we may need a booster within a year.\"How often will you need a COVID-19 booster?Despite such predictions, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told CNN the bottom line is \"we don't know.\"\"We're preparing for the eventuality that we might need boosters, but I think we've got to be careful not to let the people know that inevitably, x number of months from now, everyone's going to need a booster. That's just not the case,\" Fauci, chief medical adviser to President Joe Biden, said at a Washington Post Live event. \"We may not need it for quite a while.\"Scientists at a number of companies that make COVID-19 vaccines have also predicted the need for boosters within a year \u2014 but the scientific community is not in widespread agreement on this.\"We're making extrapolations\" from incomplete data, Fauci told The Washington Post on Thursday.So far, studies have shown that mRNA vaccines \u2014 those made by Pfizer and Moderna \u2014 maintain more than 90% efficacy six months after getting vaccinated. And scientists say it's likely much longer.Other studies have looked at antibodies in the lab. While a decline is expected over time, Fauci told the Post \"the steepness of that slope is unclear right now.\"Experts say it is also unclear how these antibody levels correlate with real-world immunity, and to what extent other parts of the immune system \u2014 such as T cells \u2014 could factor into protection.What happens if you skip the booster?Whether booster coronavirus vaccine doses are modified or not, missing a booster dose \u2014 if one is recommended in the future \u2014 could leave someone less protected against COVID-19.\"A person who skipped a booster is placing themselves at higher risk of getting infected, and getting disease from the SARS-Coronavirus-2, but I would also expect that they're going to have some partial immunity and so they may be protected against more severe disease,\" Moss said. SARS-CoV-2 is the virus that causes COVID-19.\"It's just a function of how much their immunity has waned or how different a variant is,\" he said. \"They're just at higher risk of infection and disease than someone who got the booster, but they have more immunity than someone who was never vaccinated.\"Scientists are also currently investigating whether it makes a difference if someone gets the same type of vaccine as a booster as the original dose administered.\"This question of mixing and matching certainly is relevant to booster doses,\" Moss said. \"It's also relevant to any two-dose vaccine schedule, and it's also an area of active research.\"Researchers in the United Kingdom reported last week that people who got mixed doses of coronavirus vaccines \u2014 receiving a different vaccine type as a second dose than the first dose \u2014 appear to be more likely to experience mild side effects such as fever, chills, fatigue or headache.But the side effects following mix-and-match vaccinations were short-lived and there were no other safety concerns, the researchers reported in the Lancet medical journal.As for booster doses in the future, \"I can very much envision a situation in which people might get a very different type of vaccine for that booster dose than they had originally,\" Moss said. \"The big question I have, I guess, is how much underlying scientific evidence are we going to have to support that to actually make it a recommendation? That I don't know yet, but it's certainly likely to happen by default, just because perhaps the original vaccine is not available.\"Currently, the CDC says, \"COVID-19 vaccines are not interchangeable\" and there has been no decision either in the US or globally on the need for booster doses yet, let alone which vaccine might be appropriate for any booster.Who is making booster shots?All three companies that currently have authorized coronavirus vaccines in the United States \u2014 Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson \u2014 are investigating the potential use of boosters.\"We are right now in the middle of these trials and the data are coming as we speak,\" Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla told Axios during a virtual event on Wednesday.\"The data that I see coming, they are supporting the notion that likely there will be a need for a booster somewhere between eight and 12 months,\" Bourla said. \" But that remains to be seen and I believe in one, two months we will have enough data to speak about it with much higher scientific certainty.\"The first dose of Pfizer's coronavirus vaccine in the United States was administered on Dec. 14, 2020 \u2014 five months ago. As time goes on, if people received their second dose of vaccine eight months ago, \"they may need a third one,\" Bourla said. \"This could be coming sooner than later, I believe from September, October. But this is something, again, that the data need to confirm.\"Moderna is currently conducting booster shot trials too.The fight against the coronavirus pandemic is expected to continue through next year due to the emergence of variants, Dr. Stephen Hoge, president of Moderna, said during an earnings call earlier this month.\"We think this is just the beginning,\" Hoge said. \"Therefore, we're committed as a company to make as many updates to the vaccine, to add as many variants as we think are necessary, to ensure that when people receive a booster, it provides the broadest immune protection against the widest range of variants.\"Johnson & Johnson is also looking into the potential for boosters.\"We have ongoing and planned trials that will aid our assessment of the need for, and timing of, booster doses of our vaccine,\" according to an emailed statement Johnson & Johnson sent to CNN on Thursday.Johnson & Johnson's coronavirus vaccine, along with Pfizer's, Moderna's, and four others, are being tested as seasonal boosters in a study called Cov-Boost being conducted by the UK's National Institute for Health Research and the University of Southhampton.The biotechnology company Novavax has developed a coronavirus vaccine that its chief executive officer Stanley Erck believes could be used as a booster shot for people who have already been vaccinated. The company plans to apply for emergency use authorization of its vaccine in the United States in the third quarter of 2021.\"In the US, I think it will be the booster for everyone, particularly if we get it out late in the third quarter,\" Erck told CNN last week. \"It's going to be time to start boosting \u2014 whether it's six months or at a year point.\"Who has to OK the COVID-19 booster shots?The decision to use COVID-19 boosters is expected to involve two agencies \u2014 the Food and Drug Administration and the CDC \u2014 and the regulatory process to get the shots into arms could vary depending on whether the booster is the same vaccine that was originally used or is a modified version.\"So, if it's the same vaccine, my understanding is that what would have to happen is that the CDC would have to recommend an additional dose with details around when that should occur,\" Moss said.If it's a modified vaccine, \"this is where things get interesting and I don't think we quite know,\" he said, but added that the regulatory process could be similar to what happens with flu vaccines each year.\"Technically, whenever a vaccine like that is modified, it's often considered a new vaccine and has to go through the whole process again. But there is a precedent, obviously, with influenza virus vaccines, not to do that,\" Moss said. \"So, the influenza vaccine each year doesn't have to go through a large Phase 3 trial.\"That's because the vaccine technology stays the same, and the only change is the flu virus itself that the vaccine targets to elicit immunity to a specific flu virus strain that's circulating.Moss said that's what he expects could happen with modified coronavirus vaccines.\"At this time, available information suggests that the FDA-authorized vaccines remain effective in protecting the American public against currently circulating strains of SARS-CoV-2. However, if there is an emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variant(s) in the U.S. that are moderately or fully resistant to the antibody response elicited by the current generation of COVID-19 vaccines, it may be necessary to tailor the vaccines to the variant(s),\" an FDA spokesperson told CNN on Thursday.The FDA updated its guidance for vaccine developers in February, noting that manufacturers should \"generate the data to support authorization\" of a modified vaccine.\"Further discussions will be necessary to decide whether in the future, modified COVID-19 vaccines may be authorized without the need for clinical studies,\" according to the guidance. But overall, vaccine developers are \"encouraged\" to perform exploratory studies on modified vaccines to boost immune responses.\n\nAs the COVID-19 vaccine rollout continues in the United States, with people ages 12 and older receiving their shots, vaccine makers are now preparing for a next possible phase: booster doses.

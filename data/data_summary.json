will intensify the crackdown on bitcoin mining to protect the country’s financial system, as well as meet its clean energy and reduced carbon emission goals. Photo: Reuters","1":"Some of the world’s biggest companies and deepest-pocketed investors are lining up trillions of dollars to finance a shift away from fossil fuels.\n\nAssets in investment funds focused partly on the environment reached almost $2 trillion globally in the first quarter, more than tripling in three years. Investors are putting $3 billion a day into these funds. More than $5 billion worth of bonds and loans designed to fund green initiatives are now issued every day. The two biggest U.S. banks pledged $4 trillion in climate-oriented financing over the next decade.\n\n“We’ve reached the tipping point and beyond,” said James Chapman, chief financial officer at Dominion Energy Inc., one of the country’s biggest utilities. Dominion, which has begun issuing green bonds, is planning to spend $26 billion or more on clean energy such as wind and solar in the next five years.\n\nAfter years of intermittent excitement followed by fizzled expectations, green finance is now looking less like the niche interest of socially conscious investors and more like a sustainable gold rush. Driven by surging valuations for electric-vehicle companies such as Tesla Inc. and startup battery producers, banks and investors are betting the transition from fossil fuels is here to stay, and that they can make money by getting behind it, further entrenching the shift.\n\nBehind the geyser of capital is a confluence of forces. Big money managers see opportunities for substantial profits, and they also worry about financial risks associated with climate change. Many of their clients—giant pension funds and fast-trading young investors alike—want to put their wallets behind projects that aim to curb environmental damage.","2":"Wednesday’s huge sell-off in the cryptocurrency market saw a wide range of coins and tokens lose between 30% and 50% of their value in a few hours as indiscriminate selling shattered the market’s previously bullish sentiment. The near $1 trillion sell-off, sparked by fears of a further clampdown on cryptocurrency usage in China, and negative tweets from Tesla’s Elon Musk, wiped out weeks, and in some cases months, worth of gains, with leveraged accounts trying to unwind long positions adding fuel to fire. The market has pared back some of these losses but sentiment remains weak and it will take a long time to return back to the heady times of earlier this year, if at all. The current extreme levels of volatility and weak sentiment do not make good bedfellows.\n\nOvernight news that the US Treasury Department wants new rules put in place, requiring cryptocurrency exchanges to report transactions over $10,000, has not helped sentiment. The move, part of President Biden’s upgraded measures to prevent tax avoidance, would likely come into force in 2023 if agreed.\n\nBitcoin, an underperformer over the last few months, especially against Ethereum, is stabilizing around $41,000 after touching a flash-low of $30,000 on Wednesday. The sell-off wick on Wednesday’s candle has now been recovered, but it is difficult to know how much of the heavy two-week sell-off from $60,000 can be recouped. The weekend can be a volatile period for cryptocurrencies, with volume usually lower than during the week, so it may be wise for traders to wait and see where BTC is on Monday before making any decisions.\n\nJOMO is the New FOMO: Trade with the Joy of Missing Out\n\nEthereum has a similar chart pattern to Bitcoin over the last 3 days and has also given back a chunk of its recent outperformance against its peer. The ETH\/BTC spread started the year around the 230 level and rallied all the way up to a peak of 812 last Friday. The pair now trades around 662 after touching a sell-off low of 608 on Thursday.\n\nThe alt-coin market also sustained very heavy losses mid-week with a host of the current market favorites, including Cardano (ADA), Dogecoin (DOGE) and newcomer Internet Computer (ICP), all hammered. This sector will find it even harder than the more established coins to recover.\n\nTraders of all levels and abilities will find something to help them make more informed decisions in the new and improved DailyFX Trading Education Centre\n\nWhat are your views on Bitcoin (BTC),Ethereum (ETH) – bullish or bearish??

If you're expecting a payment, see how much you'll get here. Before the IRS can send those payments, however, it will open two portals for people with qualifying dependents to make any necessary changes. The portals will also be used to opt out of the monthly payments if you'd rather get one large check, and help make sure you're registered if you don't normally file a tax return. We'll explain all the details below.\n\nThe child tax credit 2021 payments will go out on the 15th day of the month, with checks as much as $300 per child each month or $3,600 in total, depending on your children's age by the end of the year. Note that there's an income limit you must meet in order to get the full payment.\n\nWe'll tell you everything we know so far about the separate IRS portals -- and what we don't yet know. Here are some different ways to use your child tax credit checks and how you may receive your payment. Here's how you can claim an additional $8,000 to $16,000 credit for child care expenses.\n\nWhat can you do with the IRS' online child tax credit portal?\n\nTaxpayer families will be able to make changes to any life circumstances since they last filed their taxes, such as an income change and child custody status. For example, if you started making less money this year, you'll want to update the IRS about those changes so you can get the correct child tax credit amount.\n\nIf you had or will have a new baby this year, it's important to let the IRS know, so you can receive your payment for up to $3,600 for that child. The same applies if you adopted a child or if you gained a new child dependent since you last filed your taxes.\n\nAlso, if you've gained full custody of your child, you'll be the parent who receives the money for your kid. Note that parents who have shared custody will not each get a payment. This is important for domestic violence survivors, Nina Olson, executive director of the Center for Taxpayer Rights said during an IRS oversight hearing. \"That change of circumstances portal should allow them to enter their change in marital status and also where the children are.\"\n\nCan I use one of the child tax credit portals to opt out of the monthly payments?\n\nThe main portal mentioned above will also let you opt out of receiving the monthly child tax credit payments. What does that mean? It means that instead of receiving monthly payments of, say, $300 for your 4-year-old child, you can wait until you file your 2021 taxes next year to receive the $3,600 lump sum amount.\n\nYou may also want to opt out because you're expecting your circumstances to change and don't want to update your information in the portal.\n\nWhat if I don't typically file my taxes?\n\nThe IRS will open a second portal dedicated to people who don't typically file their income taxes. This child tax credit portal will allow this group to give the IRS their updated information, including the number and ages of their qualifying child dependents.\n\nThe portal is expected to let tax nonfilers submit a simplified electronic form to the IRS, to secure their eligibility. This group would include people who don't have bank accounts, and the homeless population.\n\nHow to help those who don't have a permanent address at this time\n\nRight now, the IRS is urging people to share information about the child tax credit to those who don't have permanent addresses.

Almost the size of the Ever Given that got stuck in the Suez Canal, the Marco Polo is the largest ship to ever visit the American East Coast ports.\n\n\n\nEven before everyone’s favorite cargo ship, the Ever Given, blocked the Suez Canal back in March, ports were overwhelmed and the cost of shipping containers skyrocketed. Now that manufacturing is ramping up from its COVID-19 delay, space in shipping containers comes at a dear price. From Bloomberg:\n\nThe super-charged rally in commodity prices has made shipping more expensive than any time in the past decade, reviving the fortunes of an industry that was on its knees just a year ago. The scale of the boom, with red-hot demand almost everywhere on the back of a broad economic recovery and vast stimulus programs, has stretched global shipping as products such as soybeans and logs compete with traditional cargo mainstays of coal and iron ore. The surge also highlights the pressures the commodities industry is under to meet that growth.﻿\n\n\n\nMore expensive shipping means bigger ships can make a ton of money by moving more goods, making mega ships like the Marco Polo or yes, the Ever Given, gold mines for their owners and a prayer answered for companies looking to move stuff. Still, there have been delays, not only because of the volume of goods moving around the world, but due to natural disasters like overloaded cargo ships losing record amounts of containers in historic storms or the Ever Given beaching itself and blocking the Suez Canal for six days in March during an intense wind storm.\n\nIt wasn’t until recently that East Coast ports could even handle ships like the Marco Polo, because of how high they stack their containers. From the Associated Press:\n\nWhile Los Angeles has been able to accommodate ships that can carry the equivalent of 23,000 20-foot containers — a cargo unit known as a TEU — Atlantic ports still can’t handle boats that big. As recently as four years ago a ship the size of the Marco Polo would have bypassed the ports of New Jersey and New York because the Bayonne Bridge, which connects New Jersey and Staten Island, was too low and the port system’s waterways were too shallow.\n\n Spurred by the expansion of the Panama Canal last decade that allowed larger ships to pass through, New Jersey\/New York and other East Coast ports scrambled to capitalize.\n\n The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey spent nearly $2 billion to raise the bridge by 64 feet, a feat that required keeping the existing roadway until a higher roadway was built on top of it; a separate project costing about the same amount deepened the channel in New York harbor. Savannah’s port, the fourth-busiest container port in the country, is in the final stages of a six-year, roughly $1 billion project to deepen the shipping channel. Officials expect the port to have handled 5 million containers in the current fiscal year ending June 30, just four years after surpassing 4 million for the first time.﻿\n\n\n\nThe Marco Polo can stack some 16,000 20-foot long containers on its decks and now, it just barely squeezes below the Bayonne Bridge. Seems like money well spent on our garbage infrastructure.","9":"Why did this happen?\n\nPlease make sure your browser supports JavaScript and cookies and that you are not blocking them from loading.

Industry observers believed Gates was overly arrogant during his testimony, and the government eventually reined in Microsoft's power in a landmark antitrust lawsuit.\n\nSince then, Gates has tried to shed his reputation as a cocky tech mogul, instead crafting a public image of a nerdy do-gooder, largely through his philanthropy.\n\nBut since Gates and his wife, Melinda French Gates, announced their plans to divorce, reports about his conduct toward female coworkers and his relationship with the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein have chipped away at that image.\n\nThese allegations have come from a variety of sources and mention incidents dating back years before the divorce announcement, suggesting Gates' private reputation has long diverged from the image he's portrayed publicly.\n\nHere are all the times Gates has been accused of questionable behavior.","11":"Access to this page has been denied because we believe you are using automation tools to browse the website.\n\nThis may happen as a result of the following:\n• Javascript is disabled or blocked by an extension (ad blockers for example)\n• Your browser does not support cookies\n\nPlease make sure that Javascript and cookies are enabled on your browser and that you are not blocking them from loading.","12":"A driver who was parked on the shoulder near Loop 410 and Highway 281 was taken to a hospital after calling 911 about a shooting.","13":"In David O. Russell 's dramedy, Cooper stars opposite Jennifer Lawrence as a man with bipolar disorder who moves back into his parents house.\n\nHollywood dealmaking has failed to save the industry’s top talent from a studio’s bankruptcy.\n\nThat’s the lesson from a precedential opinion out on Friday from the 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals, which reviewed what happened after the downfall of Harvey Weinstein. Unfortunately for many stars, millions of dollars in continent compensation from hit movies now seems all but lost forever.\n\nAfter Weinstein was credibly accused of sexual misconduct, his eponymous company filed for bankruptcy protection. Then in early 2019, Spyglass Media (then called Lantern) came to a deal to acquire most of Weinstein’s assets for $289 million. But did Spyglass first have to pay Weinstein’s old debts before taking over contracts that would give them rights to many films and TV shows? That’s what Hollywood’s creatives including Bradley Cooper, Jennifer Lawrence, Robert De Niro, Meryl Streep, Bill Murray and Julia Roberts insisted.\n\nSpyglass felt otherwise. According to the company, these contracts weren’t executory, meaning that obligations from the parties had already been substantially performed. The debts didn’t transfer in the Weinstein bankruptcy sale. To confirm it, Spyglass brought a test case against Silver Linings Playbook producer Bruce Cohen, who got five percent of the celebrated movie’s net profits and was owed $400,000 at the time of the bankruptcy.\n\nSpyglass won the test case — and then prevailed in the first appellate round to the chagrin of Hollywood’s above-the-line guilds which warned of consequences.\n\nNow comes yet another victory for Spyglass — and barring any rehearing by the 3rd Circuit or intervention by the Supreme Court, this one could become the final determination.\n\n“At a high level, the essence of the Cohen Agreement was for Cohen to produce the Picture in exchange for money,” writes Circuit Judge Thomas Ambro. “Thus, he contributed almost all his value when he produced the movie. At the time of TWC’s bankruptcy, the Picture had been released for six years and Cohen had not done any further work on it.”\n\nCohen’s remaining obligations like indemnification were “ancillary after-thoughts in a production agreement,” Ambro adds.\n\nOK, but what about the money owed? Surely, paying up is a material obligation of the contract.\n\nAmbro responds by rolling through the distinction between a covenant and termination provision before ultimately concluding, “[I]f we accept Cohen’s argument, then the parties also overrode protections in the Bankruptcy Code…Here, the logical implication of Cohen’s position is that the Cohen Agreement would be an executory contract forever, no matter how much he has already performed. That would be a highly unusual result and would contravene the protections created for the Debtors by the Bankruptcy Code.”\n\nThe appeals court decides the $400,000 in contingent compensation owed to Cohen does not need to be paid. The same is almost assuredly true for others involved in Silver Linings Playbook including Bradley Cooper and Robert De Niro, although Spyglass will have to pay any net profits the movie makes from here on out. But as for what was lost, Ambro writes, “This pill is bitter to swallow, but bankruptcy inevitably creates harsh results for some players.”\n\nHere’s the ruling in the Cohen case…","14":"Just like its upcoming test flight this weekend, Virgin Galactic Holdings (NYSE:SPCE) stock is positioned for a powerful liftoff. One analyst tracking the stock, UBS' (NYSE:UBS) Myles Walton, upgraded his recommendation on the stock Friday to buy from neutral. That was despite the prognosticator's price target cut; to him, it's now worth $36 per share, instead of $40.\n\nEven with that chop, Virgin Galactic still has significant upside. Walton's new level implies a gain of almost 71% on the most recent closing stock price.\n\nInvestors are bullish on Virgin Galactic just now mainly because of that test flight, the scheduling of which was confirmed by the company Thursday.\n\nWalton is encouraged by this and finds another key reason to be positive on Virgin Galactic. \"We think the faster pace of the Blue Origin offering commercial service merits watching, but we're also encouraged by the care being taken on pricing and price discovery in the near-term (as illustrated by the [roughly] $3 [million] current bid price for the first Blue Origin seat with 3 weeks left of bidding).\"\n\nBlue Origin is the commercial space tourism company launched by Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) founder and CEO Jeff Bezos. Earlier this week, the Amazon honcho's company unveiled the results of the auction for its first space ticket, and the leading bid was a whopping $2.4 million.\n\nAs a result, \"We remain positive on the fundamentals of the [Virgin Galactic] offering as well as the scarcity of the experience provided to customers,\" Walton wrote.\n\nAlthough it's early days, the twin effects of the new test flight and the robust demand for that space flight ticket are putting some real zip into Virgin Galactic's shares. Walton's hopeful note also helps. On Friday, the company's stock closed 6.4% higher.","15":"Pope Francis, who has frequently spoken out on environmental issues, will trade in his popemobile for a new model running entirely on battery power.\n\nThe pontiff met Thursday with Henrik Fisker and Geeta Gupta-Fisker, founders of the California-based electric car startup Fisker, who provided him with renderings of the vehicle they plan to deliver during the fourth quarter of next year. It will be based on the Fisker Ocean SUV the company plans to put in production in 2022.\n\n\"I got inspired reading that Pope Francis is very considerate about the environment and the impact of climate change for future generations,\" Henrik Fisker said in a statement.\n\nThe connection to the pope, Fisker told NBC News by email, was made through “a mutual friend [who] arranged the meeting.”\n\nThis is the second zero-emission vehicle that the Argentine-born pope will receive. Last year, Japanese automaker Toyota delivered a specially customized version of its Mirai fuel-cell vehicle. It’s currently one of three hydrogen-powered vehicles on the market. The Toyota popemobile has not seen extensive use, however, largely due to the challenges of finding a readily accessible source of the lightweight gas during the pontiff’s travels.\n\nTraditionally, popes have traveled in vehicles provided to the Holy See by Mercedes-Benz, with the first presented to Pope Pius XI in 1930. Recent models have included transparent compartments where the pope can stand up while also keeping him safe. That became essential following an assassination attempt on Pope John Paul II in May 1981 in St. Peter’s Square.\n\nFor his part, the current pope has maintained a low profile when it comes to the vehicles he travels in, preferring to use Fords, Jeeps and Fiats.\n\nConsidering the environmentally friendly nature of the Fisker product, and the fact that Francis met with the company founders, there’s a good chance it will find more use than Toyota’s popemobile once it is delivered.\n\nThe design is based on the Ocean, the first product Fisker plans to bring to market. Currently, it is set to go into production at a factory in Austria on Nov. 17.\n\nSeveral configurations will be offered to the public, including one capable of running 300 miles between charges. A base model with more limited range is expected to come in at $37,499 in the United States before applying the current $7,500 in federal tax credits.\n\nFisker founder and CEO Henrik Fisker has promised to offer an array of options for the retail model. The version earmarked for Pope Francis, however, will have at least one feature not available to the public: a unique, hand-built cupola in which he will be able to stand and wave to the public during his travels.\n\nThe bulletproof glass canopy, Fisker said, will be hidden within the SUV’s roof until needed by the pope. It will then rise up with the touch of a button. He declined to offer other details, such as whether the electric popemobile will use the high-performance powertrain the company is developing for the Ocean SUV. That system will be capable of launching from 0 to 60 in around 3 seconds. But it will have a few other “special details and features,” Fisker said.\n\nWhat may prove more important while on the road will be the Ocean’s quick-charge capability. The retail version will be able to get an 80 percent battery top-off in less than 30 minutes, according to the automaker.\n\nFisker told NBC News that for the green-minded pope himself, the battery drive system is only part of the appeal of the modified SUV. While some competitors likely will quibble with his claim that the Ocean is “the most sustainable vehicle in the world,” it does forgo traditional luxury materials like leather in favor of alternatives derived from recycled soft-drink bottles and even plastics reclaimed from the ocean.\n\nOne of the highlights of the project was meeting with Francis, Fisker said, noting that “the Pope even signed the sketch I did of the Ocean in a Italian café nearby, prior to the private meeting.”\n\nThe Fisker founders probably could use a little intervention from up high. They will be launching their new company at a time when the electric car market is expected to see significant growth — but also a flood of new products from traditional manufacturers like Ford, General Motors and Volkswagen, as well as upstart brands like Tesla, Rivian, Lordstown Motors and others.\n\nHenrik Fisker was a pioneer in the field, bringing a plug-in hybrid to market a decade ago. But Fisker Automotive quickly went bankrupt, its assets sold to a Chinese company.\n\nThe Danish-born entrepreneur started out as a designer, earning a solid reputation for his work on less environmentally friendly products like the Aston Martin DB9 and the BMW Z8.","16":"A passenger on a Birmingham, Ala.,-bound Southwest Airlines flight posted a concerning photo on social media Friday showing the top of a wing ripped off.\n\nThe Twitter user who posted the photo said that her airline – Flight 654 departing Chicago's Midway International Airport -- was clipped by another trying to get out of an airport gate.\n\n\"Welp, I guess it’s time for a cocktail.

According to court documents, Scerbo claimed he was the prophet Genghis Khan and accused his seatmate of being in the CIA before making inappropriate comments to her.\n\nDetails of what happened on jetBlue flight 915 initially came to light after the Captain addressed the other passengers once Scerbo had been removed from the plane by law enforcement. The Captain gave a blow by blow account of what happened, including Scerbo’s alleged drug-taking, which involved multiple trips to the bathroom and a flight attendant finding a bag of white powder in his seat.\n\nAn affidavit filed in the United States District Court for the District of Minnesota now provides even more details – including an allegation that Scerbo, who was sat in JetBlue’s Mint Business Class, threw his food on the floor and grabbed a metal butter knife from his tray and brandished it while walking up and down the aisle in full view of a young child.\n\nHis seatmate claims she saw Scerbo dip his finger into a bag of white powder and snort it, although he ended up with white powder all over his moustache, face and pants. During the flight, Scerbo was observed to visit the restroom at least six times.\n\nA flight attendant later found a bag containing a white substance at Scerbo’s seat which later field-tested positive for cocaine and weighed 24.5 grams. Scerbo told FBI agents that the powder was creatine.\n\nScerbo’s behavior became so erratic – at one point singing out loud, doing yoga moves in other passengers faces and repeatedly calling another passenger a “faggot” that the Captain decided to divert the flight so that Scerbo could be removed from the plane.\n\nScerbo has been charged with one count of possession of cocaine. If found guilty, he faces a maximum sentence of three years imprisonment. The case may also be investigated by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) which has the power to propose a civil penalty of up to $35,000.\n\nThe FBI is investigating the case.","19":"SALT LAKE CITY — You'll soon be able to fly nonstop from Salt Lake City International Airport to one of Germany's largest cities.\n\nLufthansa Group on Thursday announced a handful of new international flights it'll add next year, including three nonstop flights per week between Salt Lake City and Frankfurt, Germany. The service will be handled by the low-cost leisure travel airline Eurowings beginning in May 2022.\n\nThe group's announcement was a big step forward for the future of the airport after its new terminals opened last year. Salt Lake City had nonstop flights to London, Paris and Amsterdam, as well as flights to the Canadian cities of Calgary, Toronto and Vancouver, but all of those were halted by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nDelta plans to resume flights to Amsterdam beginning next week as nonstop international travel options slowly return. That and flights to the Mexican cities of Cancun, Guadalajara, Los Cabos, Mexico City and Puerto Vallarta are listed as the nonstop international flights from Salt Lake City available as of June this year, according to public airport documents.\n\nThere are more options on the way not just as post-pandemic life begins to emerge but also from the airport upgrades. Salt Lake City Airport Director Bill Wyatt told KSL NewsRadio Thursday that the old airport made it impossible to expand new airline carriers that were already there but that barrier is now lifted with the airport upgrades.\n\n\"Now we have these beautiful new international gates and arrival facility, and I think this is just the beginning,\" he said.\n\nWyatt added that there is hope to add flights to cities in Asia and Latin America in the near future, as well.\n\nLufthansa Group also announced new Eurowings flights from Munich to Las Vegas beginning in 2022 as a part of new flights revealed on Thursday.\n\nThe company's announcement comes as airline interest is beginning to heat up again after the travel was decimated by the economic impacts of COVID-19.\n\nU.S. Travel's April 29 report estimated that American travelers spent nearly $70 billion in travel costs during March 2021, which was a significant increase from previous months but still down from March 2019 levels. It also found that 72% of American travelers at that point planned a summer getaway, compared to 37% at the same time last year.","20":"Alden, which already owned one-third of the company and favors aggressive cost-cutting to boost profits, had drawn opposition for its bid from Tribune Publishing journalists at papers including the Sentinel, the Chicago Tribune, the Baltimore Sun, the Hartford Courant and the New York Daily News. For more than a year, they have been trying to fend off Alden, whose reputation for squeezing out bigger profit margins is notable even in an industry characterized by cost cuts and aggressive layoffs.\n\n“Local newspaper brands and operations are the engines that power trusted local news in communities across the United States,” Heath Freeman, Alden’s president, said in a statement. “The purchase of Tribune reaffirms our commitment to the newspaper industry and our focus on getting publications to a place where they can operate sustainably over the long term.”\n\nThe union representing Tribune Publishing’s journalists had opposed the sale, saying the hedge fund’s cost cuts have already led to shrinking newsrooms and closed offices. It lobbied Patrick Soon-Shiong, the owner of the Los Angeles Times and Tribune’s No. 2 shareholder, to vote no and stop the deal. The merger’s approval hinged on his vote.\n\nThe Tribune Publishing proxy filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on April 20 said abstentions are the same as a vote against the merger. “Abstentions and broker non-votes will have the same effect as a vote ‘against’ approval of the merger,” the filing said.\n\n“Dr. Soon-Shiong abstained from voting,” said Hillary Manning, a spokeswoman for Soon-Shiong. “For the past several years, Tribune Publishing has been a passive investment, as he has remained focused on the leadership roles he holds across his companies. When he made the investment in 2016, he hoped it would be a pathway to local newspaper ownership in Southern California. In 2018, he and his family were proud to acquire the Los Angeles Times and San Diego Union-Tribune from Tribune Publishing, creating the California Times. Their focus is and will be on the continued rebuilding and revitalization of The Times and Union-Tribune.”\n\nAn expected higher bid for the company from Maryland hotel mogul Stewart Bainum never fully materialized. He had been unable to find a buyer for the Chicago Tribune, a key element in his plan to return the company’s newspapers to local ownership. Hansjörg Wyss, a billionaire from Wyoming who expressed interest in owning the Chicago Tribune, joined Bainum’s bid, then subsequently dropped out.","21":"Federal authorities have ordered a complete recall of the Las Vegas-based bottled water brand Real Water and ordered the company to surrender records in investigations of at least one death and multiple cases of liver illness among people who reported drinking it.\n\nBrent Jones, the company’s president, and attorneys for the company and the bottler, AffinityLifestyles.com, did not immediately respond Friday to email messages about a US district court order issued Wednesday.

Sworn to secrecy, Mr. Zaslav’s lieutenants snacked on a breakfast of artisanal doughnuts from a 24-hour bakery as they finalized their pitch. Just before 8 a.m., ahead of schedule, their quarry arrived: John Stankey, the AT&T chief executive who controlled the WarnerMedia assets that Mr. Zaslav coveted. A journey that began with an informal, emoji-speckled email exchange in February was now fully underway. The covert discussions would eventually last three months, stretching from Dallas to the Denver suburbs to downtown Manhattan, where a war room was established in the cramped garden level of the rented townhouse. To prevent leaks, bankers used maritime nicknames like “Columbus” and “Magellan.” Even the chief executive of WarnerMedia was kept in the dark while his company was being negotiated out from under him. It would culminate on Monday with the announcement of a blockbuster media deal that combined AT&T’s WarnerMedia, including HBO, CNN and the Warner Bros. film studio, with Discovery’s cable and broadcast holdings, creating a powerful new force in American entertainment, sports, reality TV, news and streaming video. And it represented an astounding late career act for Mr. Zaslav, 61, that would put him in control of one of the biggest media companies in the world.\n\nThis account is based on interviews with 18 people who helped put together or had knowledge of the biggest media deal of the year, many of whom spoke on condition of anonymity in order to share the details of sensitive conversations. Like many a modern romance, the marriage of two of the country’s biggest media companies started with an emoji. On a chilly Saturday in February, Mr. Zaslav was watching the Golf Channel at his oceanfront East Hampton estate when he tapped out an email to the man he wanted to woo. “You around….” Mr. Zaslav wrote to the AT&T chief executive John Stankey just before 3 p.m. on Feb. 13, adding icons of a golfer and sunglasses. “I’ve been thinking….”\n\nOnly a few minutes passed before his iPhone beamed with the reply. “Always scares me when you do that :)” Mr. Stankey replied. “Would you like to chat?” Their initial conversation lasted several hours. Mr. Zaslav invited Mr. Stankey to visit him in New York on March 2. Mr. Zaslav lives in Conan O’Brien’s former apartment on Central Park West, but he bought a townhouse in Greenwich Village after his wife, Pam, grew weary of Mr. Zaslav’s impromptu meetings at their home. That townhouse was under renovation — so Mr. Zaslav rented another one, where he eventually met with his potential partner from AT&T. As the conversations gathered intensity, Mr. Zaslav looped in his Discovery brain trust for the April 1 meeting with Mr. Stankey, where he needed to put his best foot forward. Around 5:30 a.m., Mr. Zaslav was joined by two associates: Gunnar Wiedenfels, Discovery’s chief financial officer, and Mr. Campbell, his longtime lieutenant and a colleague of 24 years, who had helped hammer out many of Discovery’s acquisitions, including its $14.6 billion purchase of Scripps in 2018 and the $1.1 billion purchase of Eurosport in 2015.\n\n“That photo,” Mr. Campbell said, “became a totem or sort of the mascot of the deal to me.” Even as Mr. Zaslav negotiated with Mr. Stankey, he knew he would also have to sell the idea to two of the biggest names in American media. John Malone, the billionaire chairman of Liberty Media, and Steven Newhouse, the chairman of Advance, owner of Condé Nast, were the primary shareholders in Discovery and would need to sign off.\n• The U.S.D.A. will begin making debt relief payments to minority farmers in June.\n• Existing-home sales declined in April, with a tight supply and record prices. For advice, Discovery turned to Allen & Company; AT&T tapped LionTree, the boutique firm run by the Hollywood deal maestro Aryeh Bourkoff. Mr. Bourkoff’s presence was noteworthy: one of his earliest clients was Mr. Malone. In a reminder of the whiplash-inducing speed at which AT&T was shedding WarnerMedia, once a prized asset, one of the bankers involved, Kurt Simon of Goldman Sachs (hired by AT&T), had helped broker its purchase of Time Warner just three years prior. Now he was back at the negotiating table figuring out how to unwind it. Code names were used to ensure secrecy. For AT&T, WarnerMedia was “Magellan” and Discovery was “Drake.” The Discovery side had its own cryptic handles, calling the deal “Project Home Run,” with each company named for baseball greats: “Williams” for WarnerMedia, “Aaron” for AT&T and “DiMaggio” for Discovery. For AT&T, the appeal was obvious: shedding a big portion of the crushing debt the company had amassed. But in order to complete the transaction, AT&T needed a bridge loan — worth more than $40 billion. Goldman Sachs could not provide the entire amount, so JPMorgan stepped in to help cover the loan. Mr. Stankey insisted on another point: He wanted the new company to have a simple ownership structure, with just one class of shares that anyone could buy. It would make the company smoother to run. And by eliminating the use of shares with disproportionate voting power, the AT&T leader would ensure that the new company could be an easier takeover target in the future, should an even bigger suitor — say, Amazon or Apple — come calling.\n\nDeals are rarely smooth, and an anomaly with Discovery’s share price dovetailed with the negotiations. Discovery’s stock began to inexplicably rocket in February and March to $75 from $45 because of a convoluted trading scandal involving Archegos, a little-known private investment firm that bet big on Discovery and other companies via derivatives using billions in borrowed money. With banks forced to buy shares to hedge their spiraling exposure to Archegos, Discovery’s market value jumped nearly 60 percent, for no obvious reason to outsiders. But by May, the stock had returned to where it was during Mr. Zaslav’s initial approach, and the two sides ultimately forged a deal that gave 71 percent of the new company to AT&T shareholders and 29 percent to Discovery. Now, the trick was closing it before word could leak out. One awkward conversation awaiting Mr. Stankey was with Jason Kilar, the former chief of Hulu tapped by AT&T, with great fanfare, just a year earlier to lead WarnerMedia. To mark the occasion of his first anniversary on the job, Mr. Kilar had agreed — with AT&T’s blessing — to be profiled by The Wall Street Journal. He invited a reporter in late April to interview him on the Warner Bros. lot in Burbank, Calif., unaware that across the country, his colleagues were feverishly working to close the deal. At some point during the week of May 3, Mr. Stankey dropped the bomb: He informed Mr. Kilar that the company would soon change hands, and it was unclear what Mr. Kilar’s role might be. The 2,600-word Journal profile of Mr. Kilar, which included a quote from Mr. Stankey, was published on May 14, three days before the deal was announced. Usually a cheerful presence on Twitter, Mr. Kilar didn’t bother sharing the article with his 37,000 followers. By the weekend, Mr. Kilar had retained the entertainment power lawyer Allen Grubman to start negotiating his exit. A little after 7 a.m. on Sunday, Mr. Zaslav boarded a corporate jet at a small airport on the East End of Long Island, not far from his home, to head to AT&T’s Dallas headquarters to put the finishing touches on the deal. But just over an hour into the flight, word got out through Bloomberg’s black-and-orange terminal screens: “AT&T is in talks to combine content assets with Discovery.”","28":"Delta Air Lines Airbus A330neo or A330-900 aircraft with neo engine option of the European plane manufacturer, as seen departing from Amsterdam Schiphol AMS EHAM International airport.\n\nDelta Air Lines named on Friday longtime General Electric executive Dan Janki as its new CFO.

But during the chain’s pandemic-induced swoon Wanda converted its B shares to regular Class A, with one vote each. New shares AMC issued to raise funds diluted Wanda’s stake to well below that 30% threshold.\n\nIn March, Aron confirmed the Wanda era was over although the company continued to be AMC largest single largest shareholder then. Wanda “They have been absolutely delightful,” Aron said on a post-earnings conference call. “Now AMC will be governed like most other publicly traded companies with a wide array of shareholders.” AMC’s stake had been whittled down to 6.7%.\n\nNow it holds only 10,000 shares. It sold the stock in the open market between May 13 and May 18 at around $14 a share. That’s not bad. The shares had a nasty week this week and ended Friday down 3.67% at $12.09.\n\nThe stock’s been volatile since the company’s wide array of stockholders referenced by Aron has, as of early this year, included a rowdy ground of GameStop-loving retail investors. Flocking to chatrooms like Reddit’s Wall Street Bets, they fueled a surge in AMC shares from under two bucks to over $20. That helped Investor Silver Lake cash out with a windfall and allowed AMC to extend its financial sails amid a slow industry recovery by selling new stock at the elevated price.","31":"California accounted for an outsized portion of the nation’s new jobs last month, although its path to economic recovery from the pandemic remains steep.\n\n“In April, California was the locomotive pulling the U.S. economy forward,” said Sung Won Sohn, a professor of finance and economics at Loyola Marymount University. The Golden State created 38% of the nation’s new jobs in April. But that was mainly due to the state emerging from a “lockdown harder and longer than in many parts of the country,” Sohn said.\n\nCalifornia has a long way to go in recovering from its deep COVID-19 pandemic recession: More than half the jobs it lost have yet to return. The unemployment rate remained stagnant in April at 8.3%, the same as in March, state officials reported Friday.\n\nAlthough the state’s job creation pace was comparatively robust in April, it slowed slightly from the previous month. Employers added 101,800 new positions last month for a total of more than 16.2 million. That was less than the 132,400 jobs added in March.\n\nNearly two-thirds of California’s job growth in the last three months was in the leisure and hospitality businesses that were most damaged during the pandemic. Their employment level remained 28% below the pre-pandemic level.\n\nIn Los Angeles County, which relies heavily on tourism, the economy remained in dire straits. Unemployment grew to 11.7% from 11.4% in March and more than half a million people were counted as out of work.\n\n“Los Angeles has been especially hard-hit by closures or severe limitations of such critical industries as hospitality, dining, travel, entertainment, and film production,” said Lynn Reaser, an economist at San Diego’s Point Loma Nazarene University.\n\nThe state’s jobless rate was the second highest in the nation in April, after Hawaii’s 8.5%. U.S. unemployment stood at 6.1% last month.\n\nYear over year, California’s job growth has been slower than the nation’s; the state gained 8.7%, compared with 10.9% for the U.S.\n\nStill, economists are growing more optimistic after Gov. Gavin Newsom announced the state’s economy should fully reopen by June 15. “California’s economy is ready to boom this summer when business restrictions are lifted,” Reaser said.\n\nPomona College economist Fernando Lozano suggested job creation was “moderate” last month because many schools were only partially open, child care was sparse and federal business loans had dried up. “Many households moved to more affordable areas, yet the jobs are reopening in the more expensive, urban communities,” he said.\n\nPepperdine University economist David M. Smith predicted the Golden State economy will achieve full employment by the fall. Despite geographical mismatches, “California is a jobs-producing machine,” he said. “Unemployment in the tech-dominated San Francisco is trending at less than half that of Los Angeles with its harder-hit small businesses, and entertainment and hospitality industries.”\n\nNeel Sodha, the founder of LA Walking Tours, reduced the hours of his 13 guides during the pandemic. His company’s revenue remains half of what it was before the virus hit, despite easing COVID restrictions. “You would think that with the vaccines coming out and cases going down there would be more business,” he said. “That is not happening.”\n\nTourists remain leery of hanging out with strangers for a two-hour tour, and the limits on international travel are hurting business, he said. Before the pandemic, tourists from abroad represented about 20% of his clients. Now he rarely sees an international traveler, and about 90% of his customers are locals.\n\nApril Clemmer, owner of Old Hollywood Walking Tours, a one-woman enterprise, said her business dried up completely when the pandemic hit. She took down her reservation calendar and began giving virtual tours, during which clients could watch her presentation of 1930s Hollywood on their computer screens.\n\nPrivate tours, which enable groups of family or friends to avoid the danger of walking close to strangers, also helped. Now with the virus abating, clients have begun to inquire about public tours. “I feel like it’s ticking back up again,” she said.\n\nClemmer is so optimistic that she is training a second tour guide to handle what she expects will be a summer surge.\n\nStatewide, April employment grew in seven of California’s broad industry sectors. The largest gain — 62,800 jobs in leisure and hospitality — was mainly driven by the reopening of full-service restaurants, officials said.\n\nThe professional and business services sector, which includes lawyers, accountants and technical specialists, added 19,000 positions. Payrolls in the “other services” sector, which includes hairdressers, auto repair shops and other miscellaneous businesses, grew by 10,500.\n\nThe largest loss was in the information sector, which shrank by 3,500 jobs, mainly in software publishing.\n\nLos Angeles County payrolls added 34,600 jobs in April for a total of more than 4.14 million. The leisure and hospitality sector accounted for 58% of the new jobs. Positions in healthcare and social assistance grew by 6,000.\n\nOrange County payrolls added 23,800 jobs for a total of more than 1.54 million. Leisure and hospitality accounted for 56% of the gain. Unemployment slid to 6.2% from 6.3% in March.\n\nThe Inland Empire, spanning Riverside and San Bernardino counties, added 6,700 payroll jobs for a total of more than 1.51 million. Leisure and hospitality accounted for 4,500 of the new jobs. Unemployment was 7.6%, down from 7.7% in March.\n\nThe employment data for April are based on two federal surveys taken in the second week of the month. Payroll job numbers are based on a survey of 80,000 California businesses. The unemployment rate comes from a separate survey of 5,100 households.","32":"Gov. Dan McKee and other state officials were on hand to announce the new travel offering Friday morning. \"We are thrilled to welcome Breeze Airways to Rhode Island's skies this summer,\" McKee said. \"Our state's travel and tourism industry has endured much hardship over the past year and we are looking forward to brighter days ahead, with new routes bringing new economic opportunity and new visitors to our state.\"\n\nBreeze is a newly launched airline, created by JetBlue founder David Neelman, the Rhode Island Airport Corporation said. T.F. Green was selected as one of the 16 airports on the debut flight network. Service will start July 21, with flights offered four times per week to Charleston, South Carolina; Norfolk, Virginia and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Tickets are now on sale, with fares as low as $39 one way, the RIAC said.\n\nThe new routes brings T.F. Green to 25 non-stop routes across 11 airlines. \"These 16 cities are just the beginning for Breeze,\" Neeleman said. \"The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the nation's air service has meant many secondary and tertiary markets have seen a significant reduction in flights. There are so many city pairs needing non-stop service around the country, we have a further 100 cities under consideration. Flying non-stop, Breeze will get you there in half the time, but also for about half the price!\"\n\nSeveral Rhode Island lawmakers were on hand to welcome the new airline. Not all leaders were excited about the news, however. Sen. Sam Bell called Breeze a \"sketchy, low-cost carrier\" and called for the airport to focus on other priorities.\n\n\"Before adding more flights ... to other medium-sized cities, we should add flights on reputable airlines to major US hub destinations,\" Bell tweeted. \"It's a problem that you can't fly to lots of key big cities from TF Green: Los Angeles, Houston, Seattle, Denver, Las Vegas, Dallas, St. Louis, New York (don't @ me with New Jersey being the same thing), Montreal, Phoenix, Columbus, San Diego, San Antonio, Portland, Honolulu, Austin, Kansas City, Indianapolis or Boston.\"","33":"California is requiring ride-sharing companies such as Uber and Lyft to transition from gasoline to electric vehicles (EVs) in their networks by the end of this decade.\n\nThe state’s clean-air regulator on Thursday unanimously approved the Clean Miles Standard mandating that EVs account for 90 percent of ride-hailing vehicle miles traveled in California by 2030.\n\nAmerica is changing faster than ever!

Randolph said in a statement.\n\n“This action will help provide certainty to the state’s climate efforts and improve air quality in our most disadvantaged communities,” Randolph said.\n\nBoth Uber and Lyft have already committed to converting their fleets entirely to EVs by 2030 and have made efforts to help drivers make the shift.

An official told CBS News the federal government paying the benefits to some unemployed Americans directly is \"pretty much off the table.\"\n\nThe department is facing pressure from Democratic lawmakers and progressive groups to act as a growing number of Republican-led states have announced they will opt out of the federal program created in the wake of the pandemic.\n\nAt least 22 GOP-led states have announced this month that they will be ending enhanced unemployment benefits early. This includes the $300 a week supplemental benefits, as well as in nearly all cases the program for gig workers and self-employed individuals who do not qualify for traditional unemployment and the program for those facing long term unemployment. The state leaders claim their states have plenty of jobs and the benefits deter people from working.\n\n\"It's cruel, it's ugly, it's insidious and it's a lie,\" said Sharon Corpening, about that argument. The 60-year-old Roswell, Georgia resident was freelancing in advertising and copywriting until the pandemic hit. As such, she did not qualify for traditional unemployment, but was able to receive Pandemic Unemployment Assistance under the CARES Act, part of coronavirus relief efforts passed under President Trump that offered benefits to workers in fields not eligible for traditional benefits.\n\nWhen some state officials and business groups claim the job market is booming as the pandemic subsides, that does not mean immediate employment opportunities for her as a longtime career professional. She has been actively job hunting and networking, but she is pushing to use her expertise. And as someone with fibromyalgia, she also has health concerns.\n\n\"Them pulling the plug on this a couple months short makes a critical difference,\" Corpening said. \"They've cast this wide net, and it's devastating. Even just a few months, it means they're forcing people out of their careers.\"\n\nMany of the states announcing an end to benefits have lower vaccination rates, according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data. For 58-year-old Cindy Lang of Parma, Ohio, who is also the caretaker of her disabled parents, health is still a very real concern. When the pandemic hit, it took more than two months for the self-employed painter to receive unemployment benefits under the CARES Act.\n\n\"I'm sorry, the 400 bucks a week is like two days of my normal pay, so why would I not want to get back to work? The math doesn't add up,\" said Lang. \"It's not that we don't want to work out here. We absolutely want to work, but I'm still protecting my parents. I'm only going to start working for clients that I trust to wear masks or have been vaccinated.\"\n\nThe Labor Department also disagrees with state GOP leaders. One official called the situation \"catastrophic.\" But even if the Labor Department had the authority to provide benefits on its own, setting up the technology to do so could take months. And the department would have to obtain the unemployment data — which would need to be provided by the states now choosing to opt out.\n\nIn a letter last week to the Labor secretary, Senator Bernie Sanders said the department was \"congressionally-mandated\" to provide Pandemic Unemployment Assistance for workers ineligible for state aid and to ensure they receive such benefits, but even fot that program, while the legislative language is different, it still relies on the the states having an agreement with the secretary.\n\nHaving unemployment benefits continue may require Congress to amend the CARES Act.\n\nSome states say they will end the program as early as June 12. States are required to send the Labor Department a letter notifying them at least 30 days out of their decision to end their agreement. The Labor Department is still working out what will be included in its response to each state — pending their determination on the administration's next steps.","37":"Office-leasing company WeWork lost over $2 billion in the first quarter of 2021, as it prepares to go public through a SPAC deal more than a year after it initially sought to IPO.\n\nThe company reported a net loss of $2.06 billion on sales of $598 million.

Get caught up in minutes with our speedy summary of today's must-read news and expert opinions. Sign up here!\n\n(Kitco News) - The cryptocurrency market has been the asset class to watch this year as bitcoin prices saw a historic move to an all-time high of $65,000 a token in April.\n\nSince the start of the year, the rally in bitcoin was so potent that many investors started seeing it as a new inflation hedge and competition for gold. From the start of the year to its highs, bitcoin rallied nearly 125%.\n\nHowever, what a lot of those investors forgot is that bitcoin is an inherently volatile market. Investors have now been reminded of the inherent risks in digital currencies. This week, we saw the price of bitcoin briefly fall below $30,000 a token, a drop of 53% from its all-time highs seen last month.\n\nThe massive price swings and increase demand caused service disruptions among many digital currency exchanges. The attention and volatility prompted Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell to take the very unusual step of releasing a video statement regarding the cryptocurrency market.\n\n\"To date, cryptocurrencies have not served as a convenient way to make payments, given, among other factors, their swings in value,\" Powell said in the statement.\n\nAs the shine comes off bitcoin, investors look for a safe harbor from the volatility and uncertainty and turn their attention back to gold. Many analysts have said that with bitcoin struggling, gold prices could push back to $2,000 an ounce by the end of the year.\n\nNot only is gold a traditional safe-haven asset, but it is also an important hedge against inflation.\n\nEvery day, as the global economy continues to recover, we see new evidence of the growing inflation threat. For many analysts, this is the major factor that will continue to support gold prices throughout the year.\n\nEven the mention from the Federal Reserve that the committee could soon be talking about tapering its bond-purchasing program didn't spook gold investors. The reality is even if the Federal Reserve starts tightening its ultra-accommodative monetary policies, they are still way behind the curve.\n\nIn a commentary on Kitco.com this week, Lobo Tiggre, creator of the IndependentSpeculator.com, noted that many Americans don't know what it is like to deal with inflation, but he warned them that they soon could.\n\nHe noted that inflation is \"No merely intellectual argument for me. I can still feel the shock of that overnight devaluation of the peso in the 1970s. This truth is a visceral reality for me. This is why I still save in gold and silver to this day,\" he said.\n\nAccording to some analysts, with inflation moving higher, real interest rates could hit new historic negative lows, which is the perfect environment for precious metals.\n\nIf you need further proof of rising inflation, you don't have to look very far. Friday, analysts at IHS Markit noted that input costs for both the manufacturing and the service sectors are at their highest level since 2008.\n\nMeanwhile, on the same day, the National Association of Realtors (NAR) noted that the median home price in April rose to $341,600, the highest level on record.\n\nWhile the Federal Reserve continues to see the growing inflation pressures as transitory, many analysts note that these pressures could be around a lot longer than expected.","39":"","40":"Learning Bitcoin With Charts: How Are Hash Rate, Difficulty And Fees Related?\n\nBitcoin’s difficulty adjustment mechanism is one of its most important aspects, but learning how it works can be a daunting task. This article leverages on-chain data to visualize how this mechanism works and how it relates to hash rate, block intervals, transaction fees, and the mempool. After reading this article, you will have a better understanding of why at certain times using Bitcoin may appear to be relatively slow and expensive, but also how Bitcoin fixes this and why this process is so essential to ensure Bitcoin’s monetary properties.\n\nIf you have heard of Bitcoin, you have probably heard that its supply is hard capped at 21 million units (BTC), making it a perfectly scarce asset and thus the ultimate “hard money.”\n\nWhen Bitcoin was created, miners received 50 BTC for each new block as a reward for their work. The software has a built-in rule that after every 210,000 blocks that are mined (approximately every 4 years, if the block interval is 10 minutes), this “block subsidy” is cut in half during an event called “the halving.” During this first “reward era”’ which ended November 28, 2012, 10.5 million BTC were mined — half of its maximum supply. During the second reward era, half of that amount (10.5 million \/ 2 = 5.25 million) was issued, followed by half of that (5.25 million \/ 2 = 2.625 million) during the third reward era — and so forth. After 32 halvings, the block subsidy equals the smallest unit in Bitcoin (0.00000001 BTC = 1 sat) and cannot be split after, which means the block subsidy falls away completely after that (believed to be in the year 2140, if block intervals were 10 minutes during its entire existence). The first 14 reward eras of Bitcoin’s issuance schedule are visualized in figure one.\n\nThe careful reader will have noticed that in the previous paragraph, we mentioned twice that the actual calendar dates on which these halving events occur depend on the block intervals and that we assumed 10 minutes here. Why is it important that this supply issuance schedule is predictable in regular calendar-times in the first place?\n\nThe Importance Of Relatively Stable Block Intervals\n\nLet’s consider what it would look like if Bitcoin didn’t have a built-in difficulty adjustment mechanism, but simply had a fixed mining difficulty.\n\nIf that fixed difficulty had been set relatively high, early mining would have been very expensive and blocks would have come in at a very slow pace early on. Clearly, that wouldn’t have been ideal to bootstrap a new network and could have meant that it never succeeded in the first place.\n\nOn the other extreme, if the difficulty would have been set relatively low to incentivize early network participants to join, block intervals would have gotten smaller as more miners joined the network, and blocks would have come in at an increasingly quicker pace. It would have quickly run through its entire supply issuance schedule. Had this happened, the Bitcoin network likely wouldn’t have had enough time to develop the block space market needed to sufficiently incentivize miners to keep mining blocks in order to process transactions and secure the network after the block subsidy had run out.\n\nTo summarize, relatively stable block intervals are needed to spread out Bitcoin’s supply issuance over time, which in turn is needed to incentivize miners to keep joining the network over a relatively long bootstrapping period, as well as to gradually develop a block space market that will be able to keep the lights on after the block subsidy reward runs out.\n\nTo guarantee that block intervals will remain relatively stable over a multi decade period, Bitcoin has a difficulty adjustment mechanism. As can be seen in figure 2, even with this built-in difficulty mechanism, its block intervals were not very stable, averaging much longer than 10 minutes per block during its first year of existence. The block intervals became more stable after Bitcoin set its first market price in July, 2010, and have been relatively stable at just under 10 minutes for over five years now (no structural up or down trends in the orange line in figure 2) – works like a charm.\n\nTo mine bitcoin, miners use highly specialized computers to basically guess a certain number (slightly simplified explanation). When a miner finds the number that the network is currently looking for, that miner earns the right to create a new block on the Bitcoin blockchain, take its block subsidy, choose which transactions to include in that block, and collect the fees of those transactions. At the time of writing, all miners that are active on the Bitcoin network are estimated to have a total capacity (hash rate) of 170 exahashes per second (EH\/s), which is 170,000,000,000,000,000,000 hashes per second.\n\nIn Bitcoin’s first year of existence (2009), it was still possible to mine Bitcoin on the Central Processing Unit (CPU; which is basically the central chip in a computer that takes care of lots of things) of an average consumer computer, as the network’s hash rate was just a few million hashes per second. Over time, more computers joined the network and eventually chips that were better at heavy number crunching via their Graphics Processing Unit (GPU), the chip in a computer that is applied for graphical tasks and linear algebra) or even hardware custom made for Bitcoin mining (an ASIC, or Application Specific Integrated Circuit) was used.\n\nAs you can imagine, as the network’s hash rate increased by a multi-trillion-fold from that first year until now, it was necessary to make it a lot harder to guess that certain number to ensure relatively stable block intervals of approximately 10 minutes each\n\nIn Bitcoin, “difficulty” is the measure for how hard it is to find that number that the network is looking for. Every 2,016 blocks (14 days if block intervals are 10 minutes), the Bitcoin software basically calculates the block intervals during that period and adjusts the difficulty so that at current capacity, the average block interval will be roughly 10 minutes again.\n\nThe interplay between Bitcoin’s difficulty (the 14-day moving average of the) hash rate and block intervals over the last three months is visualized in figure 3. During the first visualized difficulty adjustment period (the red column on the left), the hash rate was declining (downtrend in black line). As network capacity decreased, block intervals increased (uptrend in blue line), making it necessary to decrease the difficulty (small drop in orange line after this period).\n\nIn three difficulty adjustment periods after (first green column in figure 3), the hashrate was increasing again, blocks came in faster than planned and difficulty adjusted upwards three times. Mid-April, 2021 (right red column), there was a large power outage in China that caused a massive drop in Bitcoin’s hash rate, slowing down blocks a lot and making a huge downwards difficulty adjustment necessary after the period. After this happened (right green column), the power outage itself was solved and the downwards difficulty adjustment made it much easier for miners to create blocks again. As a result, some miners with less efficient hardware and\/or more expensive energy could earn a profit mining again, actually overcompensating the previous loss of hash rate, actually sending it to new all-time highs.\n\nThis latest hash rate drop and recovery is a good example of why miners leaving the network does not have a cascading effect of more miners leaving the network (sometimes called the “mining death spiral” by critics), but the software simply increases the remaining miners’ profit margins, incentivizing other miners to (re)join the network.\n\nA side effect of this mechanism that we all feel is its impact on transaction fees. During times when the hash rate increases and blocks are coming in faster than planned (green columns in figure 4), transactions can relatively easily be included in blocks. Since this means that there are less transactions queued up in line (in Bitcoin called the “mempool”) to be included in upcoming blocks, transaction fees can be relatively low.\n\nThe opposite is true during periods where hash rate drops and block intervals increase (red column in figure 4). When blocks are coming in slowly, the queue of transactions waiting to get included gets crowded, and people need to bid up their transaction fees to basically jump the line. As such, transaction fees spike especially when the network capacity decreases (hash rate drops) and is waiting to be bailed out by the next difficulty adjustment.\n\nIn this section, we discussed the fees of transactions that were included in blocks. For those looking to transact on the Bitcoin network, it is even more relevant to get a feel for how much all of the transactions that are still waiting in line to be included in future blocks are bidding for their needed block space.\n\nAs briefly mentioned above, the Bitcoin mempool can be interpreted as the total of all transactions which were broadcast on the network but are still waiting in line to be included in a future block. Technically, each of the thousands of Bitcoin nodes on the network has its own mempool, but since they are mostly well interconnected, visualizing them as a single waiting line is alright for general explanatory purposes.\n\nMempool.space is an industry-standard website that gives anyone not running their own node or simply looking to get a quick look at the mempool all the relevant data. Examples are the total size of the waiting line (mempool size), how many transactions are joining the queue (incoming transactions), if blocks are coming in faster or slower than expected (estimated difficulty adjustment) and estimations of how high the transaction fee of a new transaction needs to be to be included at low, medium, or high priority.\n\nFigure 5 visualizes the mempool of the last three months. As you would expect, the patterns described in figure 4 can also be seen here. Between late February and early April 2021, when the amount of hash rate on the Bitcoin network increased and more blocks than planned were created, the mempool size (the size of the waiting line) decreased and transaction fees decreased correspondingly. After the mid-April hash rate drop, the mempool quickly increased and transaction fees skyrocketed, but both declined quite quickly after the April 30th difficulty adjustment, and subsequent hash rate growth to all-time highs.\n\nAs briefly mentioned at an earlier point in this article, Bitcoin’s block subsidy is designed to decay over time, and the development of a healthy block space market where transaction fees become the primary source of revenue for miners is essential to incentivize miners to keep processing transactions and securing the network in the long-run.\n\nThis is possibly the most important test that awaits Bitcoin in the future, and is the subject of my previous Bitcoin Magazine article titled “An Ode And Forthcoming Obituary To Bitcoin’s Four-year Cycle,” which is a recommended follow-up read.

The value of this investment type, which is a form of digital payment, frequently rises and falls violently on social media posts, internet chatter and sometimes, for seemingly no reason at all.\n\nSexy stories about investors who hit it big in crypto are making more traditional investors wonder if they should also get in the game.\n\nNJ Advance Media asked three financial advisers what they thought about crypto and whether it has a place in an investor’s portfolio.\n\nAdvisers say before you invest in cryptocurrency or any other investment, you should understand how it gets its value.\n\n“It trades more like gold, which gets its value from what people think the value is versus the profits and growth potential of a company,” said Jeanne Kane, a certified financial planner with JFL Total Wealth Management in Boonton, who noted there are more than 5,300 different kinds of crypto today.\n\nThere is no underlying asset with cryptocurrency, she said.\n\n“If you buy Apple stock, you know that the company makes computers, tablets and phones. The stock’s value comes from their sales, what they’re producing. That’s not the case with cryptocurrency because there is no underlying asset,” she said.\n\nKane said unlike traditional investments, cryptocurrency transactions and records are maintained by a decentralized network rather than a centralized authority, such as a bank or government entity.\n\nCryptocurrency is not FDIC-insured like your funds are at a bank, and there is no regulator like the Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC), which offers some protections for stocks and bonds held at brokerage firms, she said.\n\nSo the value of your cryptocurrency investment is based on what other investors are willing to pay for it.\n\nAt a minimum, those who choose to invest in crypto should have a basic understanding of what it is and what drives its value, said Claudia Mott, a certified financial planner with Epona Financial Solutions in Basking Ridge.\n\n“This is not an investment for the faint of heart given its extremely speculative nature,” Mott said. “Trading volatile assets like this can be a full-time job and those who think this is a quick way to make a buck need to consider the time and attention that needs to be paid to an investment that can gyrate 20 to 30% because of a social media post.”\n\nOr any other kind of public comment.\n\nFor example, Elon Musk appeared on Saturday Night Live on May 8 and made a joke about Dogecoin. The cryptocurrency fell 40% in mere hours.\n\nIt happened again on May 12 when Musk tweeted that he would not accept Bitcoin for Tesla.\n\n“His comment caused a selloff and drop in share values that wiped $300 billion from all cryptocurrencies in a single day,” Kane said. “Do you want a Tweet or SNL skit to boom or bust your investments?”\n\nMichael Maye, a certified financial planner and certified public accountant with MJM Financial in Gillette, said only those with a high risk tolerance should consider buying crypto.\n\n“This is currently a very high risk\/high reward investment,” he said. “Individuals who invest in crypto need to be prepared for wild swings in the price on any given day.”\n\nBut won’t I miss out if I don’t buy in?\n\nThe fear of missing out — FOMO — can make the most rational of investors become irrational, Kane said.\n\n“The media hypes up stories about the investors who paid off their student loans or received astronomical returns from their cryptocurrency investments,” Kane said. “Are we hearing as many stories about those individual investors who lost it all with a cryptocurrency market drop? Just because someone made money on Bitcoin or with another cryptocurrency doesn’t mean that you will too.”\n\nMott likened the “crypto craze” to the bubble of internet stocks that burst in 2000.\n\n“Too many inexperienced investors think they are going to make a killing trading something they have no knowledge about,” Mott said. “More than likely it will end badly for them, and for some, it already has.”\n\nI still want to buy. How can I do it smartly?\n\nAdvisers said if you do want to invest in cryptocurrency, have a balanced approach that looks at the big picture for your overall finances.\n\nMott said the price gyrations alone would argue against making cryptocurrency a significant holding in any portfolio. Also, people should not use leverage or debt “to fund an investment that could lose a great deal of it’s value and leave the investor worse off than they started,” she said.\n\nShe recommends keeping crypto out of your overall asset allocation, and use side money instead.\n\nKane said conservative investors should steer clear of a speculative investment like cryptocurrency.\n\n“If you are an aggressive investor and you feel that cryptocurrency reflects your risk tolerance and fits in the speculative part of your portfolio, invest with caution,” she said. “Given its volatility, cryptocurrency should only be a very small fraction of someone’s portfolio.”\n\nMaye said that rather than purchase individual cryptocurrencies, investors could consider Bitwise, which in 2017 introduced the first cryptocurrency index fund and now has several other offerings.\n\nBut they, too, are volatile.\n\nFor example, the Bitwise 10 Crypto Index Fund, which tracks the 10 most highly valued cryptocurrencies, lost 19% in the past month and is down 16.9% over the past three months, but is up 70.1% so far this year and has a 321% gain since its 2017 launch.\n\nMaye said he would limit crypto exposure to 5% of your portfolio, or less, given the volatility.\n\nWhat are the tax implications?\n\nIn 2014, the IRS classified virtual currencies as property and not as currency, Maye said, noting that most crypto is considered an investment asset and is subject to capital gains rules.\n\n“A crypto sold at a gain but held for less than a year is considered short term and is taxed at a taxpayer’s ordinary income tax rate,” Maye said. “A crypto that is sold at a gain but held over one year is considered long term and taxed at long-term capital gains rates, which currently range from 0% to 20% based on the taxpayer’s income level.”\n\nSome higher earning taxpayers might also owe an additional 3.8% surtax.\n\nIf a cryptocurrency investment is sold at a loss, it can be used to offset capital gains taxes plus up to $3,000 in ordinary income, Maye said. For federal tax purposes, unused capital losses can be carried forward to future tax years but many states, including New Jersey, don’t have a carry forward rule, he said.\n\nAnd on Thursday, the Treasury Department released a report detailing IRS changes as part of the American Families Plan. If passed, the bill would require reporting of crypto transfers if they exceed $10,000.\n\nHave you bought any crypto personally?\n\nNone of the advisers we spoke to have personally purchased any cryptocurrency.\n\n“I am not a speculative investor and don’t wish to blow my money on something that I may not be able to trade if the platform shuts down,” Mott said.\n\nMaye also said he hasn’t, and he has no plans to.\n\n“I do believe crypto will be around longer term as it is an interesting technology, but no one knows what regulatory environment awaits nor which crypto will dominate longer term,” Maye said.\n\nKane said crypto doesn’t fit into her investment strategy.\n\n“I’m not much of a gambler and tend to invest in mutual funds and exchange-traded funds that historically have returned on average 8 to 10%,” she said. “It may seem boring to some, but over time, it grows. Slow and steady wins my race.”\n\nPlease subscribe now and support the local journalism YOU rely on and trust.\n\nKarin Price Mueller may be reached at KPriceMueller@NJAdvanceMedia.com.","42":"Oil prices are on course for the largest weekly drop since March, although prices began to bounce back on Friday morning as optimism slowly returned to markets.\n\nFor more great energy content, make sure you subscribe to the Oilprice youtube channel for breaking news and analysis.\n\nOil is heading for the biggest weekly drop since March, following three consecutive days of huge losses.

The IEA’s Net-Zero report dropped like a bombshell midweek. The IEA said that to reach net zero, there should be no new oil, gas, and coal projects. There was no shortage of proponents and critics, but either way, the report could influence how investors think about oil.\n\nAsia snubs IEA report. “The report provides one suggestion as to how the world can reduce greenhouse gas emissions to net-zero by 2050, but it is not necessarily in line with the Japanese government's policy,” a Japanese official told Reuters. Officials in the Philippines also said no new fossil fuel investment would be a setback.\n\nOPEC warns against IEA report. “The claim that no new oil and gas investments are needed post-2021 stands in stark contrast with conclusions often expressed in other IEA reports and could be the source of potential instability in oil markets if followed by some investors,” OPEC said.\n\nU.S. and Iran near deal. The U.S. and Iran have sketched out the broad outlines of a deal to restore adherence to the 2015 nuclear agreement, which would include lifting sanctions. “We can now say that we have reached a framework or structure of an agreement,” said Iran's deputy foreign minister Abbas Araqchi, according to Argus.

It looks like he's not planning on following through on that promise anytime soon.\n\nThe Washington Post reported on Friday that in Biden's upcoming budget proposal, many of the health care promises he made during his campaign, like cutting prescription drug costs, won't be included, per four people familiar with the matter. Another major promise — canceling $10,000 in student debt — also didn't make the cut.\n\nThe proposal will include more specifics than Biden's \"skinny budget\" released in April.\n\n\"The President's budget will focus on advancing the historic legislative agenda he's already put forward for this year,\" Rob Friedlander, spokesman for the White House budget office, told the Post. \"The budget won't propose other new initiatives but will put together the full picture of how these proposals would advance economic growth and shared prosperity while also putting our country on a sound fiscal course.\"\n\nInsider reported on April 7 that Biden has yet to follow through on two student-debt promises from his campaign: to cancel $10,000 in student debt per person, and to cancel student debt for undergraduates at public colleges and Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs).\n\nIn a speech on November 16, Biden said that student loans are holding borrowers up, and forgiving $10,000 in student debt \"should be done immediately.\" His campaign website also said the president would work with Democrats to \"authorize up to $10,000 in student debt relief per borrower\" as part of COVID-19 relief, but the $1.9 trillion stimulus package he signed in March didn't include that.\n\nRead more: Forgiving student loan debt is a no-brainer, and Biden could do it tomorrow if he wanted to\n\nNeither did his $4 trillion infrastructure proposal.\n\nAnd while he said he would support legislation brought to him to cancel $10,000 in student debt, Sen.

This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on overall response rate and duration of response.1 Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in the confirmatory trials.1\n\n\"Today's FDA approval is an important development for people living with non-small cell lung cancer with exon 20 insertion mutations who, until now, have had no approved treatment options to target their disease,\" said Jill Feldman, co-founder of the EGFR Resisters, an advocacy organization patient group, and a lung cancer patient advocate. \"We are excited by the promise this new treatment option brings to people with this particular type of lung cancer and their families.\"\n\nLung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death among both men and women, accounting for almost 25 percent of all cancer deaths.3 Currently available targeted treatments, like EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) are generally insensitive in treating NSCLC driven by EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations and are not FDA-approved for these patients.4,5,6 In addition, NSCLC driven by this mutation carries a worse prognosis and shorter survival rates compared with lung cancer driven by more common EGFR mutations, such as exon 19 deletions and L858R substitutions.7,8 Patients newly diagnosed with metastatic NSCLC with EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations have a real-world median overall survival (OS) of 16.2 months (95 percent confidence interval [CI], 11.0 – 19.4), which is lower than patients with EGFR exon 19 deletions\/L858R mutations, who have a real-world median OS of 25.5 months (95 percent CI, 24.5 – 27.0).9\n\n\"Lung cancer is a complex disease, and through the study and deeper understanding of genetic alterations like EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations, we are able to target the disease in new ways and improve treatment outcomes for patients,\" said Joshua K. Sabari, M.D., New York University Langone's Perlmutter Cancer Center and study investigator, who presented the latest clinical trial results at the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer's (IASLC WCLC) 2020 World Conference on Lung Cancer Singapore. \"Amivantamab-vmjw is an innovative bispecific antibody that brings an important new therapeutic approach to physicians caring for patients with this serious and rare type of lung cancer.\"\n\nRYBREVANTTM is a fully-human bispecific antibody directed against EGFR and MET receptors.1 RYBREVANTTM binds extracellularly (outside of the cell) inhibiting tumor growth and leading to tumor cell death.1 Today's accelerated FDA approval is based on positive results from the Phase 1 CHRYSALIS study, a multicenter, open-label, clinical study evaluating RYBREVANTTM as a monotherapy in patients enrolled in the prior platinum containing chemotherapy cohort.1,10 Initial results from the CHRYSALIS EGFR exon 20 insertion mutation population, which supported the BTD, were presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology 2020 Virtual Scientific Program, and updated results were presented at the IASLC WCLC 2020.\n\n\"The approval of RYBREVANT, along with the companion diagnostic test, addresses high unmet need in the treatment of people with genetically defined non-small cell lung cancer,\" said Peter Lebowitz, M.D.,

medicines targeting specific pathways can bring the greatest benefits and improve outcomes for patients with tumor alterations such as EGFR and MET.\"\n\nThe FDA simultaneously approved Guardant Health's Guardant360® CDx liquid biopsy blood test as a companion diagnostic for use with RYBREVANTTM.\n\nNext-generation sequencing test offers an alternative to polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based

RYBREVANT, the first lung cancer treatment for Johnson & Johnson, strengthens our commitment to harness science, expertise and scale to dramatically alter the trajectory of lung cancer, and reduce the impact of the world's leading cause of cancer mortality.\"\n\nAbout RYBREVANTTM\n\nRYBREVANTTM is being studied in a comprehensive clinical development program for people with untreated advanced EGFR-mutated NSCLC, including the Phase 3 MARIPOSA (NCT04487080) trial studying RYBREVANTTM in combination with lazertinib**.12 Another Phase 3 trial, PAPILLON (NCT04538664), is studying RYBREVANTTM in combination with carboplatin-pemetrexed for people with advanced or metastatic EGFR-mutated NSCLC with exon 20 insertion mutations.13 RYBREVANTTM received U.S. FDA BTD in March 2020 and Priority Review Designation following the BLA announcement in December 2020.14,15 Janssen has filed regulatory submissions for RYBREVANTTM with health authorities in Europe and other markets.\n\n**In 2018, Janssen Biotech, Inc. entered into a license and collaboration agreement with Yuhan Corporation for the development of lazertinib.\n\nAbout the CHRYSALIS Study \n\nCHRYSALIS (NCT02609776) is a Phase 1 open-label, multicenter, first-in-human study to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics and preliminary efficacy of RYBREVANTTM as a monotherapy and in combinations including with lazertinib, a novel third-generation EGFR TKI16, in adults with advanced NSCLC.10 The study consists of two parts: RYBREVANTTM monotherapy and combination-dose escalations and RYBREVANTTM monotherapy and combination-dose expansions.10\n\nIn the ongoing Phase 1 CHRYSALIS study, patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC with EGFR Exon 20 insertion mutations weighing less than 80 kg received RYBREVANTTM 1050 mg and patients weighing at least 80 kg or more received RYBREVANTTM 1400 mg weekly for four weeks, with the initial dose as a split infusion in week 1 on day 1 and day 2, then administered every two weeks thereafter until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.1 Disease response using overall response rate (ORR), per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1* (RECIST v1.1) as evaluated by Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR), was the primary endpoint.1 In the prior-platinum chemotherapy treated cohort (n=81), the confirmed ORR, as assessed by blinded independent central review, was 40 percent (95 percent CI, 29 – 51), with 3.7 percent having complete responses (CR) and 36 percent achieving partial responses (PR).1\n\nPermanent discontinuation of RYBREVANTTM due to an adverse reaction (AE) occurred in 11 percent of patients who received RYBREVANTTM.1 AEs resulting in permanent discontinuation of RYBREVANTTM in greater than or equal to one percent of patients were pneumonia, infusion-related reactions (IRR), pneumonitis\/interstitial lung disease (ILD) dyspnea, pleural effusion and rash.1 Dose interruptions of RYBREVANTTM due to AEs occurred in 78 percent of patients.1 IRR requiring infusions interruptions occurred in 59 percent of patients.1 Adverse reactions requiring dose interruption in greater than or equal to five percent of patients included dyspnea, nausea, rash, vomiting, fatigue and diarrhea.1 The most common AEs (greater than or equal to 20 percent) in patients who received RYBREVANTTM were rash (84 percent), IRR (64

Among patients receiving treatment on Week 1 Day 1, 65% experienced an IRR, while the incidence of IRR was 3.4% with the Day 2 infusion, 0.4% with the Week 2 infusion, and cumulatively 1.1% with subsequent infusions. Of the reported IRRs, 97% were Grade 1-2, 2.2% were Grade 3, and 0.4% were Grade 4. The median time to onset was 1 hour (range 0.1 to 18 hours) after start of infusion. The incidence of infusion modifications due to IRR was 62% and 1.3% of patients permanently discontinued RYBREVANT™ due to IRR.\n\nPremedicate with antihistamines, antipyretics, and glucocorticoids and infuse RYBREVANT™ as recommended. Administer RYBREVANT™ via a peripheral line on Week 1 and Week 2. Monitor patients for any signs and symptoms of infusion reactions during RYBREVANT™ infusion in a setting where cardiopulmonary resuscitation medication and equipment are available. Interrupt infusion if IRR is suspected. Reduce the infusion rate or permanently discontinue RYBREVANT™ based on severity.\n\nInterstitial Lung Disease\/Pneumonitis1\n\nRYBREVANT™ can cause interstitial lung disease (ILD)\/pneumonitis. Based on the safety population, ILD\/pneumonitis occurred in 3.3% of patients treated with RYBREVANT™, with 0.7% of patients experiencing Grade 3 ILD\/pneumonitis. Three patients (1%) discontinued RYBREVANT™ due to ILD\/pneumonitis.\n\nMonitor patients for new or worsening symptoms indicative of ILD\/pneumonitis (e.g., dyspnea, cough, fever). Immediately withhold RYBREVANT™ in patients with suspected ILD\/pneumonitis and permanently discontinue if ILD\/pneumonitis is confirmed.\n\nDermatologic Adverse Reactions1\n\nRYBREVANT™ can cause rash (including dermatitis acneiform), pruritus and dry skin. Based on the safety population, rash occurred in 74% of patients treated with RYBREVANT™, including Grade 3 rash in 3.3% of patients. The median time to onset of rash was 14 days (range: 1 to 276 days). Rash leading to dose reduction occurred in 5% of patients, and RYBREVANT™ was permanently discontinued due to rash in 0.7% of patients.\n\nToxic epidermal necrolysis occurred in one patient (0.3%) treated with RYBREVANT™.\n\nInstruct patients to limit sun exposure during and for 2 months after treatment with RYBREVANT™. Advise patients to wear protective clothing and use broad spectrum UVA\/UVB sunscreen. Alcohol free emollient cream is recommended for dry skin.\n\nIf skin reactions develop, start topical corticosteroids and topical and\/or oral antibiotics. For Grade 3 reactions, add oral steroids and consider dermatologic consultation. Promptly refer patients presenting with severe rash, atypical appearance or distribution, or lack of improvement within 2 weeks to a dermatologist. Withhold, dose reduce or permanently discontinue RYBREVANT™ based on severity.\n\nOcular Toxicity1\n\nRYBREVANT™ can cause ocular toxicity including keratitis, dry eye symptoms, conjunctival redness, blurred vision, visual impairment, ocular itching, and uveitis. Based on the safety population, keratitis occurred in 0.7% and uveitis occurred in 0.3% of patients treated with RYBREVANT™. All events were Grade 1-2. Promptly refer patients presenting with eye symptoms to an ophthalmologist. Withhold, dose reduce or permanently discontinue RYBREVANT™ based on severity.\n\nEmbryo Fetal Toxicity1\n\nBased on its mechanism of action and findings from animal models, RYBREVANT™ can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to the fetus. Advise female patients of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for 3 months after the final dose of RYBREVANT™.\n\nAdverse Reactions1 \n\nThe most common adverse reactions (≥20%) were rash, IRR, paronychia, musculoskeletal pain, dyspnea, nausea, fatigue, edema, stomatitis, cough, constipation, and vomiting. The most common Grade 3 or 4 laboratory abnormalities (≥2%) were decreased lymphocytes, decreased albumin, decreased phosphate, decreased potassium, increased alkaline phosphatase, increased glucose, increased gamma-glutamyl transferase, and decreased sodium.\n\nAbout the Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson\n\nAt Janssen, we're creating a future where disease is a thing of the past.

It’s never been easier to get a vaccine, so don’t miss your shot to enter!”\n\nOther than getting the COVID vaccine, you do not have to do anything to enter. Your name will automatically be added to the random drawing. The drawing will include everyone who got a COVID shot in Oregon from the time COVID shots were first offered through June 27. People who got the shot at sites controlled by the federal government, including Veterans Affairs and tribal vaccination sites may be entered but that information is not routinely shared with the state.\n\nThe Oregon Health Authority (OHA) will draw names for winners in each category with the assistance of the Oregon Lottery. Winners will be contacted and will have the chance to opt out or give their consent to receive their prizes.\n\nDr. Ashby Monk, director of the Stanford Global Project, said Oregon approached him in April to ask if there were \"gamification\" strategies that could help encourage people to get the COVID vaccine. He said games that motivate people absolutely work and that many of us use some form of that in our lives.\n\n\"To help you eat right by tracking your food calories and leveling up every day. To work out more, competing against your friends through different applications. Study longer. I use it to sleep better. The academic research backs all this up. Games increase extrinsic motivation,\" he said.\n\nGov. Kate Brown has said Oregon will drop most COVID restrictions when 70% of eligible adults get vaccinated. The lottery prizes are an attempt to get more people to get the shot so they can qualify for the awards.\n\nWhen the governor announced the 70% target May 11, 430,000 more Oregonians needed to get at least the first shot to reach that goal. As of May 21 the number is 290,000, according to the Oregon Health Authority. At the current rate of vaccination the 70% goal could be reached during the second week in June.","48":"Today, by the way of checking the prices of Tesla cars, we came across a strange thing.

The dual-motor Long Range version will follow after that.\n\nThe main difference for the Plaid+ version is probably the battery, which is expected to provide a range of more than 520 miles (837 km), compared to 390 miles (628 km) in Plaid and 412 miles (663 km) in Long Range versions.\n\nIt's difficult to say anything, but maybe the availability of the more energy-dense batteries for the Plaid+ are not yet ready for prime time? There might be other difficulties as well.","49":"The airline said it has taken following steps after the data security incident: Secured the compromised servers, engaged external specialists of data security incidents, notified and in talk with the credit card issuers and reset the passwords of Air India frequent flyer programme.

The cheapest gas in the U.S. is found in Mississippi and Louisiana, where the average price of regular unleaded is $2.72 per gallon.\n\n“The unfortunate news is AAA expects gas prices on Memorial Day to be the most expensive they’ve been since 2014,” said Sergio Avila, AAA Nevada spokesman.\n\nGas prices in Nevada are up almost 20 cents per gallon in the last month, as prices were at $3.41 per gallon on April 20. Prices are up 23 cents per gallon compared with the same time in 2019, when gas sold for $3.47 per gallon. Last year when many states, including Nevada, were in lockdown due to the pandemic and demand was much lower, gas prices in the Silver State were at $2.36 per gallon.\n\nThe average price in Las Vegas is slightly higher than the state average, at $3.62 per gallon, up 19 cents from a month ago, according to AAA data.\n\nAvila pointed to increased demand and the price of crude oil as two factors.\n\n“I would say Nevada typically falls in the top five most expensive states for gasoline and, yes, the main reasons are us getting the majority of gasoline from California as well as pretty high gas taxes,” Avila said.\n\nAvila said the shutdown of the nation’s largest gasoline pipeline because of a ransomware attack was not a factor in the recent price rise.\n\nThe closed pipeline reopened Wednesday and is expected to resume normal operations by next week. The closure led to gas shortages on the East Coast as well as a spike in prices.\n\nThe spike in gas prices won’t affect the number of people who will hit the road for the long holiday weekend, Avila said.\n\n“AAA has learned the price of gasoline doesn’t curtail travelers from taking road trips but it may impact how much they spend while on their trip,” Avila said.\n\nAAA predicts that 37 million people will travel 50 miles or more from home for the Memorial Day holiday, a 60 percent increase over 2020.\n\nGas prices are expected to decrease as June rolls around.\n\nContact Mick Akers at makers@reviewjournal.com or 702-387-2920.

The company is seeking $10 billion in damages and wants the case tried in front of a jury.\n\nThe complaint alleges that while most of McDonald's advertising budget is allocated for the \"general market,\" it maintains a \"separate 'African American' tier, run by a different advertising company, \"with a much smaller budget and less-favorable pricing and other terms.\"\n\nHow much smaller? \"McDonald's President and CEO Chris Kempczinski makes approximately $11 million per year, which is more than double what McDonald's spends per year on all of Black-owned media combined,\" Allen's networks say.\n\nUSA TODAY has reached out to both McDonald's and Allen's companies for comment.\n\nIn its complaint, Entertainment Studios says it was never asked to respond for requests for proposals from the white-owned ad agency that allocates the general market budget, shutting them out of the opportunity to win its business. \"Instead, Entertainment Studios was forced to compete with African American media companies in the less-favorable African American tier.\"\n\nIn addition, it alleges McDonald's has refused to advertise on the 12 networks of Entertainment Studios or even the Weather Channel which Allen bought in 2018 and does not target any ethnic group.\n\nThe complaint notes that Allen personally took the issue of McDonald's discriminatory ad practices up with its chief marketing officer – to no avail.\n\n\"This is about economic inclusion of African American-owned businesses in the U.S. economy,\" said Allen in a statement that accompanied the lawsuit. \"McDonald's takes billions from African American consumers and gives almost nothing back. The biggest trade deficit in America is the trade deficit between White corporate America and Black America, and McDonald's is guilty of perpetuating this disparity. The economic exclusion must stop immediately.\"\n\nOn Thursday, the same day the lawsuit was filed, McDonald's announced it was allocating more ad dollars to diverse-owned media and embarking on multi-year partnerships with them.\n\n\"McDonald’s total investment in diverse-owned partners – including Black, Hispanic, Asian Pacific American, Women and LGBTQ-owned platforms – will more than double, moving from 4% to 10% of national advertising spend between 2021 and 2024,\" it said in a press release. \"Spend with Black-owned properties, specifically, will increase from 2% to 5% of national advertising spend over this time period.\"","57":"Deere has capitalized on high commodity prices, turning in terrific earnings.

Indian officials said this week that 98% of its population of about 1.3 billion remains susceptible to infection.\n\nIndia's foreign minister plans to visit the United States in the coming weeks in part to ease Pfizer's concerns, one of the sources said. He could offer Pfizer some form of protection from lawsuits in exchange for the company providing additional assistance with distributing its shots in India, two other sources said.\n\nThe Indian foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nOne of the sources added that the two parties discussed the indemnity issue as recently as late this week but have not yet reached a resolution.\n\nA Pfizer spokeswoman said that the company is still in talks with India on a deal and they have not reached an impasse, adding that Pfizer remains hopeful about reaching an agreement.\n\nPfizer has been consistent in its position on indemnity and is not planning to change its approach for a deal with India, one of the sources said. All of the sources declined to be identified because they are not authorized to speak to the media.\n\nIndia's health ministry did not reply to Reuters requests for comment on Friday.\n\nIndia pledged last month to fast-track approvals for overseas vaccine makers including Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson and Johnson.\n\nHowever, none have since sought permission from India's drug regulator to sell their vaccine there.\n\nOne source said that another issue being discussed between Pfizer and New Delhi was the Indian government's insistence on a local trial for any vaccine approval. The source added that Pfizer cannot finalize terms of a supply agreement, including indemnity, if the vaccine is not first authorized for use in India.\n\nPfizer withdrew its application for emergency use authorisation for the vaccine developed with Germany's BioNTech in February after India insisted on such a trial.\n\nBut three other shots on sale in India, developed by AstraZeneca, Russia's Sputnik V and Bharat Biotech in collaboration with state-run Indian Council of Medical Research, have completed the small-scale safety trials.\n\nPfizer's chief executive Albert Bourla said on May 4 that he was hopeful that the government would change its policy of local trials and that a path to delivering the drugmaker's shots in India could be found.

These rates are based on the assumptions shown here. Actual rates may vary.\n\nWhat this means: Mortgage rates hung around at unprecedented levels this week. The average mortgage rate fell by a few basis points since last Friday. While 30-year fixed rates saw a slight decrease, 20, 15 and 10-year fixed rates have held firm since last week.\n\nTo find the best mortgage rate, start by using Credible, which can show you current mortgage and refinance rates:\n\nBrowse rates from multiple lenders so you can make an informed decision about your home loan.\n\nCredible, a personal finance marketplace has 4,500 Trustpilot reviews with an average star rating of 4.7 (out of a possible 5.0).\n\nToday’s mortgage refinance rates end the week at record lows, unchanged since yesterday with the average rate for 15-, 20- and 30-year fixed loans sitting at 2.542%. That’s down significantly from last week’s average of 2.708%. Rates for 30-year fixed refinance loans experienced the largest decrease, falling .250 points in seven days.

But your personal financial history will also determine the rates you’re offered.\n\nIf you want to get the lowest possible monthly mortgage payment, taking the following steps can help you secure a lower rate on your home loan:\n\nIt’s also a good idea to compare rates from different lenders to find the best rate for your financial goals. According to research from Freddie Mac, borrowers can save $1,500 on average over the life of their loan by shopping for just one additional rate quote — and an average of $3,000 by comparing five rate quotes.\n\nCredible can help you compare current rates from multiple mortgage lenders at once in just a few minutes. Are you looking to refinance an existing home? Use Credible’s online tools to compare rates and get prequalified today.\n\nThe average mortgage interest rate has not budged from 2.406% in four days.\n\nThe current interest rate for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage is 2.750%. This is the same as yesterday. Thirty years is the most common repayment term for mortgages because 30-year mortgages typically give you a lower monthly payment. But they also typically come with higher interest rates, meaning you’ll ultimately pay more in interest over the life of the loan.\n\nThe current interest rate for a 20-year fixed-rate mortgage is 2.750%. This is the same as yesterday. Shortening your repayment term by just 10 years can mean you’ll get a lower interest rate — and pay less in total interest over the life of the loan.\n\nThe current interest rate for a 15-year fixed-rate mortgage is 2.125%. This is the same as yesterday. Fifteen-year mortgages are the second most common mortgage term. A 15-year mortgage may help you get a lower rate than a 30-year term — and pay less interest over the life of the loan — while keeping monthly payments manageable.\n\nThe current interest rate for a 10-year fixed-rate mortgage is 2.000%. This is the same as yesterday. Although less common than 30-year and 15-year mortgages, a 10-year fixed-rate mortgage typically gives you lower interest rates and lifetime interest costs, but a higher monthly mortgage payment.\n\nYou can explore your mortgage options in minutes by visiting Credible to compare current rates from various lenders who offer mortgage refinancing, as well as home loans.

If so, you're in good company. And in reality, a few million dollars isn't an unreasonable goal for a retirement nest egg. Remember, the savings you carry into your senior years will need to last for several decades, and starting out with a couple of million or more is a good way to help ensure you don't run out of money in your lifetime.\n\nFurthermore, you may have the goal of becoming a millionaire before reaching your senior years. That's a reasonable objective, too.\n\nThe key, either way, is to start investing at an early age and choose your investments wisely. And guess what? You don't have to be an investing guru to check the latter box off. All you really need to do is put this one ETF in your portfolio.\n\nETFs, or exchange-traded funds, make investing really simple. The reason? You can buy shares of a single ETF and add dozens of stocks or more to your portfolio. And if your goal is to wind up a millionaire, the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF(NYSEMKT: VOO) is a good bet.\n\nThe S&P 500 indexconsists of – you guessed it – 500 stocks, only they're not just any stocks. Those 500 companies are the largest ones that trade publicly, so they're a solid measure of how the stock market, on a whole, is performing. As such, an ETF that aims to match the performance of the S&P 500 is a good one to have in your portfolio.\n\nInvesting questions:How to get started in 6 steps\n\nMicrosoft, PayPal, Okta:New investors should consider these 3 great starter stocks\n\nElon Musk, Snoop Dogg and Mark Cuban love Dogecoin:Should you? How to stay safe when investing in cryptocurrency\n\nSince its inception in 2010, The Vanguard S&P 500 ETF has delivered a 15.74% return, which practically mimics the S&P 500's 15.78% return during that time. Say you invest $500 in this one ETF every month and its performance is comparable – let's call it 15%. Keep that up for 30 years, and you'll be sitting on a cool $2.6 million.\n\nEven if the S&P 500 – and the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF – only delivers an average annual 10% return during that time, you'll still be looking at just about $1 million in your portfolio from that investment alone.\n\nPlus, the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF has a very low expense ratio – just 0.03%. That's the beauty of ETFs – you won't pay high investment fees that eat away at your returns because these funds are passively managed.\n\nAn easy way to accrue millions\n\nThe Vanguard S&P 500 ETF is only one of many ETFs that track the S&P 500. And to be clear, there are other indexes you could look at if your goal is to grow long-term wealth. But the S&P 500 has a strong history of delivering solid returns, and it's a good bet if your goal is to become a millionaire without doing a lot of work to get there.\n\nThe one drawback of buying shares of the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF is that it won't help your portfolio outperform the broad market. But if you're happy with matching its performance, this ETF could make you very wealthy.\n\nMaurie Backman has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

Cordish was proposing to build a casino on 17 acres of Bow Tie Partners-owned land at 1301 N. Arthur Ashe Blvd.\n\nFour other casino operators submitted proposals to build in Richmond in February, and in the following months the city gradually cut the field down to Urban One and Cordish.\n\nKnown for its dozens of radio stations, including four in Richmond, Urban One teamed up with Peninsula Pacific Entertainment on its bid for a casino. Peninsula Pacific owns and operates Colonial Downs Racetrack and five Rosie’s Gaming Emporium locations in Virginia, along with a pair of casinos in New York and Iowa.\n\nUrban One got a taste for the casino business in 2016, when it invested $40 million for a minority stake in MGM National Harbor, a resort casino in Maryland.\n\nIn a prepared statement released Thursday, Urban One CEO Alfred Liggins thanked the city and lauded the tax revenues Urban One estimates the project would generate.\n\n“We are fully committed to creating good paying jobs with profit-sharing for employees, pathways to successful careers, and generating significant new tax revenues that can improve Richmond’s schools and fund community programs and infrastructure,” Liggins said.\n\nIn addition to a 100,000-square-foot gaming floor and 250-room hotel, Urban One’s project would also include a 3,000-seat theater, a 20,000-square-foot event space, 55 acres of green space with a festival lawn, and 12 restaurants. Liggins has previously said they’re in talks with some local restaurateurs to open concepts at the development.\n\nUrban One claims the project would generate $525 million in tax revenue over the next decade, and that they would pay the city a $140 million up-front payment. Per its website, Urban One estimates that 77 percent of the casino’s visitors would be non-locals.\n\nStoney, who said the project would be “an additional economic engine in South Richmond,” is now preparing to introduce the casino matter to the Richmond City Council at its May 24 meeting.\n\nIf approved, it would head to the Virginia Lottery Board, which regulates casinos in the state, before the city petitions Richmond Circuit Court for the referendum to be placed on the ballot in November.\n\nZed Smith, The Cordish Cos.’ COO, issued a statement expressing their disappointment in losing out on the deal.\n\n“While we believe our site clearly would have brought the largest long-term economic benefit to the City and its residents, as evidenced by the City’s own independent, outside consultant, we respect the Evaluation Committee’s decision,” Smith said.\n\nPhilip Morris owns the land on which Urban One is planning the project. It’s unclear whether the firm has it under contract for purchase.","66":"Japan on Friday approved the Moderna and AstraZeneca coronavirus vaccines for use in adults, giving the country much-needed new options as it tries to speed up an inoculation campaign that has been one of the slowest in the developed world.\n\nPreviously, only the Pfizer vaccine had been authorized for use in Japan, where just 4.1 percent of the population has received a first shot. Vaccinations have been held up by strict rules that allow only doctors and nurses to administer shots, and by a requirement that vaccines be tested on people in Japan before they are approved for use.\n\nJapan is in the midst of a fourth wave of coronavirus infections, just two months before the Summer Olympics in Tokyo are set to begin. Tokyo and eight other prefectures are under a state of emergency that will last at least until the end of this month, and Okinawa is expected to be added to that list. Japan has been reporting about 5,500 cases a day, compared to 1,000 in early March.\n\nA Health Ministry panel recommended on Thursday night that the government approve the Moderna and AstraZeneca vaccines. The health minister, Norihisa Tamura, said that the Moderna shots would be used at mass inoculation sites scheduled to open on Monday in Tokyo and Osaka, which will be staffed mainly by military doctors and nurses.","67":"An AMC employe sanitize the counter after each customer at the AMC Burbank theatre concession stand on reopening day in Burbank, California, March 15, 2021. (Valerie Macon\/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nCalifornia workforce regulators will aim for a mid-June easing of workplace mask and social distancing requirements to conform with a broader state order, postponing a vote on whether to revise coronavirus safety rules for employees.\n\nCal\/OSHA’s staff said it would aim “to make possible a targeted effective date of June 15, 2021,” instead of proceeding with a proposal that would have made businesses wait until July 31 to ease some pandemic restrictions.\n\nThe same regulations also would impose new requirements that dozens of business groups called too onerous during a hearing Thursday by the California Occupational Safety and Health Standards Board.\n\nHaving two conflicting enforcement dates would be “a huge source of confusion and problems,” California Chamber of Commerce policy advocate Rob Moutrie told the board.\n\nThe board delayed voting on the new rules after staff said they wanted to reconsider them based on last week’s U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidance that fully vaccinated people can now skip face coverings and distancing in virtually all situations.\n\nCalifornia health officials said this week they will keep the state’s rules requiring indoor masking and distancing until the state more broadly lifts its pandemic restrictions on June 15, a date also endorsed by Gov. Gavin Newsom.\n\nBut Cal\/OSHA board members said they are inclined to temporarily retain revised workplace safety rules perhaps past July 31, over the objections of some business groups. They set a June 3 hearing to consider revised rules.\n\n“I think we need to continue to have some COVID requirements in place — the crisis isn’t over. But I think we need to recognize that it’s been mitigated to some extent,” board member Chris Laszcz-Davis said.\n\nCal\/OSHA regulations apply in almost every workplace in California, including those in state and local governments. Its emergency temporary standards related to the pandemic apply to all employees except those working from home or where there is a single employee who does not have contact with other people.\n\nCalifornia has made a remarkably fast transition from being an epicenter for the virus at the start of the year to a record low infection rate of less than 1% and an economy with all sectors now reopened, albeit with restrictions. More than half the state’s population of nearly 40 million has received at least one vaccine dose.\n\nEmployers told the board that the improvement makes the rules less necessary, while worker advocates said having half the population unvaccinated means precautions are still needed.\n\nProposed additional employer mandates intended to make up for some relaxed regulations would “create new unnecessary burdens and requirements,” said Helen Cleary, director of the Phylmar Regulatory Roundtable, a coalition of large businesses.\n\nBusiness groups are particularly upset with a proposal requiring that employers provide masks for voluntary use starting July 31.\n\nThat potentially means regularly providing N95 face masks to 2 million workers, CalChamber’s Moutrie said, assuming 20% of the state’s 20 million workers can’t or won’t be vaccinated and half of those work indoors. The rules also would require employers to provide free coronavirus testing during work hours to unvaccinated employees with COVID-19 symptoms.\n\nStandards board chairman David Thomas later said he was inclined to permit less effective face coverings like his own blue surgical-style mask. But others said that easing some safeguards makes it more important that workers have the type of mask that provides the most protection.\n\nThomas, like other board members, said regulators must be cautious in lifting safety regulations for fear of triggering a new surge.\n\n“Hopefully we’re getting to a place where we can open things up,” Thomas said, but “we’ve seen this before and we just don’t want to get, for lack of a better word, we don’t want to get stupid.”\n\nRequiring employers to provide masks and make other provisions like installing partitions and air filters “adds more burdensome obligations to employers just as the federal government is loosening restrictions and California’s Governor appears to believe California is on track to open in June,” more than 40 groups said in a comment letter. They include organizations representing California cities and counties, retailers and restaurateurs.\n\nMore than 40 agricultural organizations separately objected that “the state cannot reopen if businesses are still required to comply with strict and unnecessary COVID-19 restrictions.”\n\nBut labor and other advocates urged caution in lifting workplace pandemic safety rules.\n\n“Every day we hear from workers about their fear of going to work, getting the virus and bringing it home to their families,” said Eddie Sanchez of the Southern California Coalition for Occupational Safety and Health, which advocates particularly for workers who are immigrants or people of color. ”We know from experience now that employers will not do what’s right or what’s safe on their own.”\n\nMaggie Robbins, occupational health specialist with Worksafe Inc., an Oakland-based worker advocacy group, said Cal\/OSHA shouldn’t ease workplace rules just because the state is relaxing requirements in social settings, a development she said could “lead to basically open season in the workplace for all controls to be relaxed.”\n\nThe board’s staff is now reconsidering rules that would require workers to wait until July 31 before they can stop wearing masks indoors and distancing, unless everyone in the same room is fully vaccinated and not showing coronavirus symptoms.\n\n“Exemptions for fully vaccinated employees will not work if 100% of the workforce must be vaccinated to benefit,” Cleary said.\n\nBut Cal\/OSHA’s staff warned that some regulations are needed even as conditions improved. “Even if the state is able to reopen fully in June, COVID-19 is likely to remain a significant workplace hazard for months to come, if not longer,” they advised the board.","68":"Oregon was left scrambling last Thursday after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention unexpectedly announced that fully vaccinated people no longer needed to wear masks or physically distance in most circumstances.\n\nThe Oregon Health Authority responded to the announcement by trying to walk a fine line, issuing new guidance Tuesday that allows people to go maskless outside and gives businesses the option to either continue requiring masks or allow fully vaccinated customers who show proof of inoculation to forgo masks indoors. The approach appears to be unique among states reacting to the federal guidelines.\n\nBut by neither fully lifting nor retaining mask mandates, and instead requiring businesses and other institutions to check vaccination cards, Oregon has managed to please essentially no one.\n\nThat’s what a panel of some of the state’s largest business organizations and worker groups told state lawmakers during a House COVID-19 subcommittee hearing Wednesday.\n\n“To ask our employees to enforce a mask mandate under these new conditions or verify vaccine status at the door will further escalate confrontations in our communities and is simply not realistic,” said Amanda Dalton, president of the Northwest Grocery Association, which represents 300 chain and community grocers across Oregon. “We’re not aware of any other state today taking the card-check approach to the CDC guidance.”\n\nStates have taken varied approaches to the new federal guidance. Some, like New York, are allowing fully vaccinated people to stop wearing masks immediately, while others, like California, are keeping mask requirements in place for now.\n\nOregon Health Authority Director Patrick Allen told lawmakers that the state settled on its approach after consulting businesses, unions and worker groups within the state.\n\nBut businesses and unions pushed back against those assertions.\n\nJess Giannettino Villatoro, political director for Oregon AFL-CIO, and Paloma Sparks, general counsel at Oregon Business and Industry, said their organizations were informed that the rules were coming but were not offered a chance to provide input before the state rolled out the new guidance.\n\n“I would not use the phrase ‘worked with,’” Sparks said. “He informed us of what they would be doing and seemed pretty immune to our feedback and our concerns about how this was going to be implemented.”\n\nSeveral of the business groups invited to testify said the state has put business owners in an “impossible situation” with the new requirements.\n\nThey said Oregon’s failure to issue formal guidance for five days after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s announcement last Thursday created confusion and led to many in the public thinking that mask mandates had already been dropped.\n\nThey said that businesses that continue mandating masks risk losing customers, but few businesses feel comfortable with the alternative, either. They criticized the state for once again asking businesses to enforce public health policy by requiring them to review vaccination cards, without giving them any tools or training, or considering the burden that the new rules will put on frontline workers.\n\nFred Meyer said Thursday that it will continue to require masks in response to Oregon’s new guidance, despite its parent company, Kroger, suspending mask requirements elsewhere in the country.\n\nOregon’s Enchanted Forest amusement park announced Monday that it would delay its reopening plans after some people responded with threats and angry comments to its decision to continue to require masks.\n\nDalton said she heard from a family grocer in Central Oregon as well that said some of its employees had threatened to quit after the way they were treated by customers while trying to enforce the state’s new mask rules.\n\nThe panelists said businesses remain worried that they could open themselves up to litigation by asking for customers’ health information and remain confused on how to effectively implement the state’s guidance.\n\nSome wondered how businesses are supposed to stop customers from showing fake vaccination cards or simply taking off their masks after entering. Others wanted to know whether the state expected businesses to store customers’ vaccination information or force customers to verify their vaccination status every time they shop.\n\n“We really need clear guidance for our folks,” said Jenny Dresler, legislative and grassroots counsel for the Oregon State Chamber of Commerce. “They are so confused and so scared of the possibility of lawsuits in this space. The top thing I heard from our members was, ‘How do we get out of this mess?’”\n\nWorkers groups were similarly concerned about the new guidance.\n\nCourtney Graham, political & electoral strategist at SEIU Local 503, said the guidance will not only put an undue burden on frontline workers, but could put the health of those workers at risk if customers who are not fully vaccinated skirt the rules and forgo masks. Most frontline workers in Oregon didn’t become eligible to receive vaccines themselves until April 5.\n\n“The new guidance could put some workers in a challenging position,” Graham said. “Workers who are immunocompromised themselves or live with someone who is, workers with young children and workers who haven’t yet had the opportunity to become fully vaccinated.”\n\nThere was less agreement on how Oregon should change its guidance to address the concerns of businesses and workers.\n\nSome panelists raised the possibility of allowing customers to self-attest to their vaccination status, while others said the state should consider rolling back its guidance to mandate masks indoors until a greater percentage of Oregon’s population is vaccinated. Dalton pointed to other states that have set dates to remove mask mandates rather than rushed to issue new guidance.\n\nWhat’s clear, Dalton said, is that Oregon’s current guidance isn’t working.\n\n“You have a real problem across the state right now,” Dalton said. “You have had a real problem since Thursday night.”","69":"Oatly’s chief executive says demand for its oat milk has ‘completely exploded’ during the pandemic. Photograph: Marta Lavandier\/AP IPOs Shares in alt-milk maker Oatly surge on US stock market debut Swedish firm valued at $13bn as investors bet on soaring demand for plant-based food alternatives\n\nOatly is using the money from the initial public offering to expand its global network of factories, enabling it to quadruple production from 350m litres of oat milk a year to 1.4bn in two years. Its plans include a large site in Peterborough, East Anglia.\n\nToni Petersson, Oatly’s chief executive, said demand for its oat milk had “completely exploded” during the pandemic with the company currently experiencing “triple-digit growth on three continents”. The company’s sales doubled from $204m in 2019 to $421m last year, although losses widened from $35.6m to $60.4m.\n\n“We currently have four factories and by the end of 2023 we’re going to have nine,” said Petersson of its plans after the Nasdaq listing. Production constraints meant that shops often sold out of cartons of Oatly before the weekend, he said: “Demand is no problem … it is our ability to supply that is the thing.”\n\nIn February the Swedish company revealed it was working on a flotation, and on Wednesday the shares were priced at $17. That was at top of its target range, giving the company an opening valuation of $10bn. It raised $1.1bn in new shares with existing investors cashing in to the tune of $335m. At open the shares rose as high as $22.74.\n\nOatly’s worth has soared over the past year and sales have accelerated, even amid disruption caused by the pandemic. Last summer, it sold a 10th of the company to a group of investors that included Blackstone, Oprah Winfrey and Jay-Z, but that deal valued the business at just $2bn.\n\nThe listing is a big moment for Oatly which, after several decades in the Swedish wilderness, hit the big time thanks to its guerrilla marketing. When one first-time drinker declared “it tastes like shit!” the company put that on its carton. It has also picked a fight with the dairy industry, with Petersson appearing in one of its ads singing “Wow, no cow!”\n\nPetersson, now a wealthy man owing to his 1.5% stake in Oatly, said he and other top executives achieved the IPO while working from home in Sweden. He also insisted that despite morphing into a multibillion-pound corporate, the company will not change.\n\n“Yeah, we’re gonna be super boring,” Petersson joked, before adding: “Our mission, our purpose is not going to change. It is the opposite. With scale we can have a greater positive impact on the planet.” Its success was based on its ability to connect with consumers and do that “you have got to be legit”, he added.","70":"Chouquette Chocolates is selling the cicadas -- dipped in either milk or dark chocolate -- online, but it also posted the recipe on its Facebook page for brave chefs looking for something to do with the bugs.\n\nBillions of cicadas from Brood X are emerging from their subterranean homes as temperatures warm up in the eastern United States.

The would-be maker of quiet supersonic business aircraft said it had trouble securing funding in the \"current financial environment\" and was going through the \"appropriate steps\" in light of the situation.\n\nThe company had focused its attention on the AS2, billed as the first privately-designed supersonic business jet. It was meant to cruise at speeds over 1,000MPH without the sonic booms and cabin noise that plagued aircraft like the Concorde. It was supposed to fly by 2024 and enter service by 2026. Aerion had a number of high-profile partners, including Boeing and GE, and garnered praise from Florida's governor when it unveiled plans to build a factory at the Orlando Melbourne International Airport.\n\nAerion didn't say what would happen to the company's assets following the shutdown.

Investors have rushed into major digital currencies such as bitcoin and a growing industry of financial products tied to them, prompting regulators to lay out new rules for a rapidly growing world.\n\nFinancial regulators appointed by President Biden Joe BidenJudge agrees to unseal 2020 ballots in Georgia county for audit George Floyd's family to visit White House on Tuesday Biden: US will provide vaccinations for South Korean service members MORE have recently pledged to crack down on any manipulation or abuse within the cryptocurrency industry, while advocates for the industry insist the government must lay out clear, consistent rules for all to follow.\n\nHere are five reasons cryptocurrencies are spurring action from Washington:\n\nAs stocks blasted to record highs through 2020, major cryptocurrencies exploded right beside them. The price of one bitcoin skyrocketed from roughly $7,300 at the start of 2020 to a peak of $63,503 in mid-April of this year. Other prominent cryptocurrencies such as ethereum and even coins created as jokes such as dogecoin saw similarly meteoric rises, which prompted a cycle of investor enthusiasm driven by soaring prices and prominent onetime supporters such as Elon Musk Elon Reeve MuskChina bans Tesla cars from some government compounds: report Musk tells Moscow he could expand Tesla manufacturing to Russia Business opposition hasn't moved the needle in voting rights fight; sports might MORE.\n\nBut the rally buckled in a major way this week not long after Musk disavowed bitcoin, knocking $30,000 off its price — two months of growth — and 40 percent off its value since last Friday.\n\n“If you’re a crypto investor, you’ve probably had to deal with major drops in the past. But this time around felt especially painful,” wrote Lule Demmissie, president of Ally Invest, in a Friday research note.\n\n“Bitcoin has looked like the classic case of a crowded trade that turned. Investors have jumped from Bitcoin to Ethereum to Dogecoin in search for the hottest trend in the crypto space. This week, crypto holders rushed to the exits, with all three coins down 30% or more from their peaks,” Demmissie added.\n\nMajor banks and investment firms that once refused to touch cryptocurrencies are now accepting digital tokens as an enduring part of the financial sector, helping legitimize the burgeoning technology.\n\nAfter the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) gave the banks it regulates the green light to hold cryptocurrency for clients, U.S. Bank, Bank of New York Mellon and Citibank took steps to offer crypto services. Goldman Sachs, one of the earliest investment banks to embrace cryptocurrency, announced this month its plan to offer bitcoin derivatives amid intense demand for crypto-linked bets, fueling concern among industry skeptics.\n\n“My broader concern is that these initiatives were not done in full coordination with all stakeholders. Nor do they appear to have been part of a broader strategy related to the regulatory perimeter. I believe addressing both of these tasks should be a priority,” Acting Comptroller of the Currency Michael Hsu said during a House hearing this week.\n\nWhile Wall Street power players have begun to dip their toes in the crypto world, the online trading platforms and applications that grew beside the digital currency boom have hit several technical and political speedbumps.\n\nCoinbase, the biggest cryptocurrency exchange, and other firms experienced outages this week amid the crypto sell-off, and Binance — another exchange — limited all but a handful of cryptocurrency options trades amid the frenzy, drawing backlash from users.\n\nThe intense price swings and the technical issues they’ve spawned have prompted more skepticism among Democratic lawmakers about the legitimacy and safety of cryptocurrencies as investment products.\n\nSen. Sherrod Brown Sherrod Campbell BrownDemocrats worry Jan. 6 probe could divert their agenda Sherrod Brown pushes watchdog to keep crypto firms out of banking system Biden faces big decision on Fed leadership MORE (D-Ohio), chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, urged the OCC this week to take a closer look at decisions made by his predecessors to allow some crypto trading and custody firms to offer some banking services nationally.\n\n“A firm that cannot meet the rigorous requirements applicable to other banks should not be allowed to present itself to the public as a bank,” Brown said, calling cryptocurrencies “risky and unproven.”\n\nBut Peter Van Valkenburgh, research director at cryptocurrency think tank Coin Center, countered that the OCC’s supervision is more likely to protect preexisting customers of such firms than drawn in new ones.\n\n“A bunch of people are already using this thing,\" he said. \"Do you want them to use it through a company that's got heavy-duty federal regulation, or do you want them to go and find an international exchange that is licensed anywhere? Because they will.”\n\nSome critics of cryptocurrencies dismiss them as little more than vehicles for money laundering and fraud. While those are far from the only current or potential uses, high-profile instances of crimes involving cryptocurrencies — including the $5 million in bitcoin ransom received by the alleged Colonial Pipeline hackers — have stoked concerns about regulatory gaps.\n\nThe cryptocurrency industry doesn’t fall neatly into the jurisdiction of any one state or federal regulator, making it difficult to set uniform standards or crack down on potential crime.\n\nThe Treasury Department is responsible for collecting taxes on cryptocurrency and ensuring compliance with anti-money laundering rules. The Securities and Exchange Commission has jurisdiction over certain investment offerings involving cryptocurrencies, while the Commodity Futures Trading Commission has jurisdiction over other products, partially because digital coins themselves blur the lines between securities and commodities.\n\nAnd while federal bank regulators will monitor how the firms they supervise handle crypto, there is no one federal agency with the authority to regulate spot cryptocurrency exchanges, forcing many firms to get state-by-state certification from money transfer supervisors.\n\n“While it's novel, it's incumbent on those regulators to understand it because this stuff is not going away,” said Ethan Silver, partner at law firm Lowenstein Sandler.\n\nWith more investors buying more cryptocurrencies for more money, the IRS has stepped up its efforts to make crypto owners aware of their tax burdens. The agency caused a stir in 2019 when outlining how crypto investors, some unsuspecting, would need to declare income from investments and potentially pay capital gains taxes.\n\nBut the IRS drew even more backlash Thursday after it announced that under President Biden’s plan to bolster tax compliance, individuals would have to report receiving cryptocurrency with a fair market value of more than $10,000, akin to how they currently report cash transactions.\n\nBitcoin fell sharply after the announcement, which evoked fears of steep tax bills or limited future price growth among investors.\n\n“As long as we're just providing equal treatment between cash and crypto, we're providing needed clarity, and that's almost always positive,” Van Valkenburgh said.","75":"Electrek sat down with Darren Palmer, head of battery-electric vehicles at Ford, to discuss the automaker’s launch of the F-150 Lightning and the company’s broader electric ambitions.\n\nAfter Ford unveiled the F-150 Lightning this week, the EV community was for the most part impressed by the specs and the price point that the automaker announced.\n\nThe performance are comparable or better than Ford’s best gas-powered pickup trucks.\n\nOn the electric side, with a starting price under $40,000 for a base version with 230 miles (370 km) of range and an extended range option with 300 miles (480 km) of range, it is hard to complain.\n\nSome will of course, but for the most part, the EV community seems to agree that Ford could sell as many F-150 Lightning pickup trucks as they can produce.\n\nThat’s why when we sat down with Darren Palmer, head of battery-electric vehicles at Ford, our first question was about bringing the electric pickup to volume production.\n\nPalmer said that Ford is not sharing planned production capacity, but he made it clear that they are aiming for volume production of the electric truck:\n\n“I think you can see we are not in this to build a couple of trucks and the facility that you saw President Biden visit this week, where the truck is going to be built, is significant. We also need to get the batteries to do this. We are doing that and you are going to see more about that at the capital market day next Wednesday, but again, we are not in this for a couple of trucks.”\n\nFord hasn’t confirmed the battery pack capacity of the truck yet, but both options are definitely over 100 kWh.\n\nThe company is well aware that if they plan to produce the F-150 Lightning in volume, it is going to need a lot of battery cells.\n\nA supply partnership with SK Innovation was secured early on to supply the cells for the electric F-150 and Ford took it a step further this week with a joint-venture with SK to deploy another 60 GWh of battery cell production capacity in the US.\n\nIn our interview, Palmer hinted at more announcements on the battery front during an event coming on Wednesday.\n\nYou can watch our full interview with Darren Palmer on Youtube or the audio version on the Electrek Podcast (Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Overcast, Pocket Casts, Castro, and RSS):\n\nPalmer also made a point that Ford relies heavily on customer feedback in the development of its vehicles and the F-150 Lightning is no exception.\n\nIt starts with commercial customers who require reliable vehicles at the right price point and retail consumers benefit from that while Ford also listens to them for all the features and niceties that you’d expect in a consumer vehicle.\n\nTherefore, with the F-150 Lightning, Ford made sure that truck buyers would get all the capacity and features they are used to plus all the advantages of electric vehicles.\n\nOne of those features that Ford is betting on is Vehicle-to-Load, which enables F-150 Lightning owners to power their home, a job site, or virtually anything using the truck’s battery pack.\n\nPalmer also explained that Ford is trying not to overwhelm buyers with electrification and it is trying to simplify the process of going electric.\n\nFor example, with the extended range version, Ford is providing an 80-amp charger that enables charging the large battery of the truck overnight.\n\nThe company is also not releasing all the nitty-gritty details of the truck’s electric powertrain, like the kWh capacity of the battery pack, which Palmer believes most people don’t really understand, but he did say that Ford will release all the details, including usable and full battery pack capacity, ahead of production next year.\n\nWe expect Ford to share more details and highlight more features of the F-150 Lightning over the next year – leading up to the start of production in mid-2022.\n\nSubscribe to Electrek on YouTube for exclusive videos and subscribe to the podcast.","76":"(Bloomberg) -- Former U.S. Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers said cryptocurrencies could stay a feature of global markets as something akin to “digital gold,” even if their importance in economies will remain limited.\n\nSpeaking at the end of a week in which Bitcoin whipsawed, Summers told Bloomberg Television’s “Wall Street Week” with David Westin that cryptocurrencies offered an alternative to gold for those seeking an asset “separate and apart from the day-to-day workings of governments.”“Gold has been a primary asset of that kind for a long time,” said Summers, a paid contributor to Bloomberg. “Crypto has a chance of becoming an agreed form that people who are looking for safety hold wealth in. My guess is that crypto is here to stay, and probably here to stay as a kind of digital gold.”\n\nIf cryptocurrencies became even a third of the total value of gold, Summers said that would be a “substantial appreciation from current levels” and that means there’s a “good prospect that crypto will be part of the system for quite a while to come.”\n\nComparing Bitcoin to the yellow metal is common in the crypto community, with various estimates as to whether and how quickly their total market values might equalize.\n\nYassine Elmandjra, crypto analyst at Cathie Wood’s Ark Investment Management LLC, said earlier this month that if gold is assumed to have a market cap of around $10 trillion, “it’s not out of the question that Bitcoin will reach gold parity in the next five years.” With Bitcoin’s market cap around $700 billion, that could mean price appreciation of around 14-fold or more.\n\nBut Summers said cryptocurrencies do not matter to the overall economy and were unlikely to ever serve as a majority of payments.\n\nSummers is on the board of directors of Square Inc. The company said this month that sales in the first quarter more than tripled, driven by skyrocketing Bitcoin purchases through the company’s Cash App.\n\nSummers’ comments were echoed by Nobel laureate Paul Krugman, who doubted crypto’s value as a medium of exchange or stable purchasing power, but said some forms of it may continue to exist as an alternative to gold.\n\n“Are cryptocurrencies headed for a crash sometime soon? Not necessarily,” Krugman wrote in the New York Times. “One fact that gives even crypto skeptics like me pause is the durability of gold as a highly valued asset.”\n\nSummers also said that President Joe Biden’s administration is heading in the “right direction” by asking companies to pay more tax. He argued policy makers in the past had not been guilty of pursuing “too much antitrust” regulation although he warned it would be “badly wrong” to go after companies just because of increasing market share and profits.Returning to his worry that the U.S. economy risks overheating, Summers said the Federal Reserve should be more aware of the inflationary threat.“I don’t think the Fed is projecting in a way that reflects the potential seriousness of the problem,” he said. “I am concerned that with everything that’s going on, the economy may be a bit charging toward a wall.”\n\nMore stories like this are available on bloomberg.com\n\nSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.","77":"It's the third-largest Mega Millions jackpot of all time.\n\nSomeone in the Keystone State is half a billion dollars richer.

Real estate experts say this is an indication that shortages of everything from lumber to kitchen appliances are reverberating throughout an already red-hot market — good news for sellers, but a situation that threatens to price out a growing number of buyers, despite mortgage rates that remain near historic lows.\n\nExisting home sales fell from an annualized 6.01 million to 5.85 million, the National Association of Realtors said on Friday. The consensus had been for a tiny uptick to 6.02 million.\n\nThe plunge can be attributed to a lack of inventory, said Nick Bailey, chief customer officer at RE\/MAX. It’s a perfect storm for home buyers: Builders are contending with widespread and unprecedented supply chain choke points just as the swelling population of millennials is seeking to transition into larger homes to accommodate families.\n\n“It's the millennial population driving this market,” Bailey said. “A lot of them are turning to new construction, but because of labor and supply costs, builders are being very deliberate about how quickly or how slowly they bring things onto the market.” The lumber shortage has been well-documented, but there are a host of other supply chain choke points plaguing home builders, from copper for wiring to PVC pipe — even for often taken-for-granted inputs like kitchen appliances.\n\nThis combination of factors means that last year’s sharp escalation of home prices is set to continue. According to the National Association of Realtors, the median sales price on an existing-single-family home hit a record $334,500 in March.\n\n“We have a major housing shortage in America,” said Lawrence Yun, the trade group’s chief economist. The problem predated the arrival of Covid-19, he said, and was greatly exacerbated by a sudden influx of buyers seeking more space while locked down in the early months of the pandemic and a shutdown of construction sites, factories and lumber mills.\n\n“Supply chain issues have added several weeks to the time it takes to build a home,” said John Burns, CEO of John Burns Real Estate Consulting. Big builders bid up prices on the items they need for construction and then pass along those costs — and then some — to buyers who are in little position to negotiate given the dearth of available supply, while small builders are often locked out entirely, Burns said.\n\n“Suppliers have to take care of their largest customers first,” he said. “The surge in demand that is allowing builders to push price, and putting even more strain on the supply chain as the demand for materials has surged.”\n\nEven with much of the American economy returning to normal, those aftereffects will continue to have a long tail, experts predicted. Commerce Department data released earlier this week found that the number of housing starts unexpectedly tumbled to an annualized 1.57 million, compared with expectations of about 1.7 million.\n\n“We’ve seen a continuation of appreciation in most markets,” Bailey said. Too many buyers chasing after too few properties is triggering bidding wars, and, in some neighborhoods, competition is so fierce that many homes are sold before they even hit the market, he said.\n\nAccording to Zillow, nearly half of the people who sold homes last month accepted an offer within a week. “As millennials age into the peak years of homeownership, we expect that the demand for housing will be very strong in the coming years,” said Chris Glynn, Zillow’s principal economist.\n\nWhile low interest rates are contributing to the continued appreciation, even that can’t always make a mortgage a financial reality for buyers, Glynn said. “The challenge interest rates can’t solve is the one barrier to entry — down payments,” he said. “Prices rising definitely adds to the challenge of coming up with that down payment,” he said. Programs that let buyers put down less than the traditional 20 percent can help, but in some markets, he said, would-be buyers find that this puts the cost of a monthly mortgage payment out of reach.\n\n“Given the housing shortage and strong demand — there's nothing to suggest home prices will be falling,” Yun said.\n\nYun suggested that President Joe Biden’s infrastructure plan should incorporate initiatives aimed at getting buyers into homes.\n\n“It's not a good outcome for the country,\" Yun said. \"We want to make sure that people who are making financially responsible decisions should have access to homeownership. We need to build more, and more consistently, so home prices come down,” he said.","79":"(WTAJ) – Natural Balance Pet Foods, Inc. is voluntarily recalling certain cat food products due to possible salmonella contamination.\n\nPer a release from the U.S. Drug & Food Administration, the risk was discovered from a routine state surveillance sample from the Minnesota Department of Agriculture.

The decline narrowed to below 10% that same afternoon, but Bitcoin had still lost about $70 billion in market value in 24 hours.\n\nBitcoin has lost about 38% of its value since April 13 when it hit a high of more than $64,800, according to Coindesk. The China warning was just the latest headwind: Before Wednesday, Tesla’s decision to not accept the digital currency as payment for cars — after it said it would — and murmurings in Washington about tighter regulation of digital currencies had put pressure on Bitcoin. The price is still up about 31% in 2021 and nearly 300% from a year ago.\n\nHere’s a look at Bitcoin and digital currencies in general:\n\nBitcoin is a digital currency that is not tied to a bank or government and allows users to spend money anonymously. The coins are created by users who “mine” them by lending computing power to verify other users’ transactions. They receive Bitcoins in exchange.\n\nThe coins also can be bought and sold on exchanges with U.S. dollars and other currencies. Some businesses take Bitcoin as payment, and a number of financial institutions allow it in their clients’ portfolios, but overall mainstream acceptance is still limited.\n\nBitcoin on the upswing:Bitcoin, cryptocurrencies rebound amid volatile week of trading\n\nChicago Tribune has a new owner:Tribune investors approve hedge fund takeover, shifting control of Chicago Tribune\n\nBitcoins are basically lines of computer code that are digitally signed each time they travel from one owner to the next. Transactions can be made anonymously, making the currency popular with libertarians as well as tech enthusiasts, speculators — and criminals.\n\nBitcoins have to be stored in a digital wallet, either online through an exchange like Coinbase, or offline on a hard drive using specialized software. According to Coinbase, there are about 18.7 million Bitcoins in circulation and only 21 million will ever exist. The reason for that is unclear, and where all the Bitcoins are is anyone’s guess.\n\nWHAT HAPPENED TO THE PRICE?\n\nOn Wednesday, a statement posted on the Chinese Banking Association’s website said financial institutions should “resolutely refrain” from providing services using digital currencies because of their volatility.\n\nVirtually every cryptocurrency fell after the industry group’s statement.\n\nAs of 4:15 p.m. eastern time that day , Bitcoin was down more than 7% at around $40,310 per coin. Most cryptocurrencies lost between 7% and 22% of their value and shares of Coinbase dropped 5.4%.\n\nIt’s not unusual for the value of Bitcoin to change by thousands of dollars in a short time period, though swings totaling around $20,000 in one day are extreme. On the last trading day of 2020, Bitcoin closed just under $30,000. In mid-April, it flirted with $65,000.\n\nYes, and a fairly big one. Musk announced in February that his electric car company Tesla had invested $1.5 billion in Bitcoin. In March, Tesla began accepting Bitcoin as payment. Those actions contributed to the run-up in Bitcoin’s price, and Musk also promoted the digital currency Dogecoin, which also spiked in value.\n\nHowever, Musk reversed course in just a short time, saying last week that Tesla would stop accepting Bitcoin because of the potential environmental damage that can result from Bitcoin mining. The announcement sent Bitcoin falling below $50,000 and set the tone for the big pullback recently in most cryptocurrencies.\n\nA number of Bitcoin fans pushed back on Musk’s reasoning. Fellow billionaire Mark Cuban said that gold mining is much more damaging to the environment than the mining of Bitcoin.\n\nA 2019 study by the Technical University of Munich and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology found that the Bitcoin network generates an amount of CO2 similar to a large Western city or an entire developing country like Sri Lanka. But a University of Cambridge study last year estimated that on average, 39% of “proof-of-work” crypto mining was powered by renewable energy, primarily hydroelectric energy.\n\nThere had been some concern among Bitcoin investors that Tesla would sell some or all of its Bitcoin holdings, but Musk indicated in a tweet Wednesday that Tesla was sticking with its investment.\n\nBut some companies are using Bitcoin?\n\nThe digital payment company Square and its CEO Jack Dorsey, also the CEO of Twitter, have been big proponents of Bitcoin.\n\nOverstock.com also accepts Bitcoin, and in February, BNY Mellon, the oldest bank in the U.S., said it would include digital currencies in the services it provides to clients. And Mastercard said it would start supporting “select crypto currencies” on its network.\n\nBitcoin has become popular enough that more than 300,000 transactions typically occur in an average day, according to Bitcoin wallet site blockchain.info. Still, its popularity is low compared with cash and credit cards.\n\nIs there skepticism around Bitcoin?\n\nYes, plenty of it.\n\nTracking Bitcoin’s price is obviously easier than trying to figure out its value, which is why so many institutions, experts and traders are skeptical about it and cryptocurrency in general.\n\nDigital currencies were seen as replacements for paper money, but that hasn’t happened so far. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has said the central bank prefers to call crypto coins “crypto assets,” because their volatility undermines their ability to store value, a basic function of a currency.\n\nWhile some banks and financial services companies are getting in on it, others are staying away.\n\nRegulators aren’t very worried about a possible crash in digital currencies dragging down the rest of the financial system or economy.\n\nEven with the recent sell-off, digital currencies have a market value of about $1.72 trillion, according to the website coinmarketcap.com. But that pales compared with the $46.9 trillion stock market, $41.3 trillion residential real estate market and nearly $21 trillion Treasury market at the start of the year.\n\nThe European Central Bank said Wednesday that the risk of cryptocurrencies affecting the financial system’s stability looks “limited at present.” In large part, that’s because they’re still not widely used for payments and institutions under its purview still have little exposure to crypto-linked instruments.\n\nEarlier this month, the Federal Reserve said a survey of market contacts found roughly one in five cited cryptocurrencies as a potential shock to the system over the next 12 to 18 months. That’s a turnaround from the fall, when a similar survey found none mentioning cryptocurrencies.\n\nHow much oversight is there?\n\nWashington officials have been talking about regulating digital currencies more, and worries about a heavier hand have played a role in the recent swoon in prices.\n\nGary Gensler, who took over as chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission last month, has said that cryptocurrency markets would benefit from more oversight to protect investors.\n\nIn a hearing before the House’s financial services committee earlier this month, Gensler said neither the SEC nor the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which he used to head, has a “regulatory framework” for trading on cryptocurrency exchanges yet. He said he thought Congress would ultimately have to address it because “there’s really not protection against fraud or manipulation.”\n\nHow did Bitcoin come to be?\n\nIt’s a mystery. Bitcoin was launched in 2009 by a person or group of people operating under the name Satoshi Nakamoto. Bitcoin was then adopted by a small clutch of enthusiasts. Nakamoto dropped off the map as bitcoin began to attract widespread attention. But proponents say that doesn’t matter: The currency obeys its own internal logic.\n\nAssociated Press Reporters Matt Ott, Ken Sweet and Stan Choe in New York contributed.","83":"(CNN) As the Covid-19 vaccine rollout continues in the United States, with people ages 12 and older receiving their shots, vaccine makers are now preparing for a next possible phase: booster doses.\n\nCurrently three coronavirus vaccines are authorized for emergency use in the United States -- the two-dose Pfizer\/BioNTech vaccine for ages 12 and older, the two-dose Moderna vaccine for ages 18 and older and the single-dose Johnson & Johnson vaccines for ages 18 and older.\n\nResearchers and health officials suspect that the immunity against Covid-19 these vaccines elicit in the body might wane over long periods of time -- say, possibly, after a year or more -- and might not protect as well against coronavirus variants that could emerge and evolve.\n\nTherefore, a vaccinated person might need a booster dose of vaccine to stay protected against the original coronavirus strain and newly emerging variants -- somewhat similar to how a tetanus booster is recommended every 10 years or different flu vaccines are recommended each year.\n\nWill booster doses or new vaccines be needed?\n\nIn the case of Covid-19 vaccines it remains unknown for how long immune protection lasts, but vaccine developers and health officials know it may not be forever -- and that emerging variants could escape immunity.\n\n\"There is a little nuance with Covid-19 vaccines,\" Moss said.\n\nWhile typical booster doses use same vaccine someone previously received to remind the immune system about immunity to a pathogen, any future boosters for the Covid-19 shot could use different vaccines altogether.\n\nBut Americans should prepare to have a Covid-19 vaccine booster shot within a year, US Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy told CNN's Wolf Blitzer on Thursday.\n\n\"We have to see how long the protection lasts. We know it lasts at least six months, but we'll have to see,\" Murthy said. \"It's very possible, though, and people should be prepared for the fact that we may need a booster within a year.\"\n\nHow often will you need a Covid-19 booster?\n\nDespite such predictions, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told CNN the bottom line is \"we don't know.\"\n\n\"We're preparing for the eventuality that we might need boosters, but I think we've got to be careful not to let the people know that inevitably, x number of months from now, everyone's going to need a booster. That's just not the case,\" Fauci, chief medical adviser to President Joe Biden, said at a Washington Post Live event. \"We may not need it for quite a while.\"\n\nScientists at a number of companies that make Covid-19 vaccines have also predicted the need for boosters within a year -- but the scientific community is not in widespread agreement on this.\n\n\"We're making extrapolations\" from incomplete data, Fauci told The Washington Post on Thursday.\n\nSo far, studies have shown that mRNA vaccines -- those made by Pfizer and Moderna -- maintain more than 90% efficacy six months after getting vaccinated. And scientists say it's likely much longer.\n\nOther studies have looked at antibodies in the lab. While a decline is expected over time, Fauci told the Post \"the steepness of that slope is unclear right now.\"\n\nExperts say it is also unclear how these antibody levels correlate with real-world immunity, and to what extent other parts of the immune system -- such as T cells -- could factor into protection.\n\nWhat happens if you skip the booster?\n\nWhether booster coronavirus vaccine doses are modified or not, missing a booster dose -- if one is recommended in the future -- could leave someone less protected against Covid-19.\n\n\"A person who skipped a booster is placing themselves at higher risk of getting infected, and getting disease from the SARS-Coronavirus-2, but I would also expect that they're going to have some partial immunity and so they may be protected against more severe disease,\" Moss said. SARS-CoV-2 is the virus that causes Covid-19.\n\n\"It's just a function of how much their immunity has waned or how different a variant is,\" he said. \"They're just at higher risk of infection and disease than someone who got the booster, but they have more immunity than someone who was never vaccinated.\"\n\nScientists are also currently investigating whether it makes a difference if someone gets the same type of vaccine as a booster as the original dose administered.\n\n\"This question of mixing and matching certainly is relevant to booster doses,\" Moss said. \"It's also relevant to any two-dose vaccine schedule, and it's also an area of active research.\"\n\nResearchers in the United Kingdom reported last week that people who got mixed doses of coronavirus vaccines -- receiving a different vaccine type as a second dose than the first dose -- appear to be more likely to experience mild side effects such as fever, chills, fatigue or headache.\n\nAs for booster doses in the future, \"I can very much envision a situation in which people might get a very different type of vaccine for that booster dose than they had originally,\" Moss said. \"The big question I have, I guess, is how much underlying scientific evidence are we going to have to support that to actually make it a recommendation? That I don't know yet, but it's certainly likely to happen by default, just because perhaps the original vaccine is not available.\"\n\nAll three companies that currently have authorized coronavirus vaccines in the United States -- Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson -- are investigating the potential use of boosters.\n\n\"We are right now in the middle of these trials and the data are coming as we speak,\" Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla told Axios during a virtual event on Wednesday.\n\n\"The data that I see coming, they are supporting the notion that likely there will be a need for a booster somewhere between eight and 12 months,\" Bourla said. \" But that remains to be seen and I believe in one, two months we will have enough data to speak about it with much higher scientific certainty.\"\n\nThe first dose of Pfizer's coronavirus vaccine in the United States was administered on December 14, 2020 -- five months ago. As time goes on, if people received their second dose of vaccine eight months ago, \"they may need a third one,\" Bourla said. \"This could be coming sooner than later, I believe from September, October. But this is something, again, that the data need to confirm.\"\n\nModerna is currently conducting booster shot trials too.\n\nThe fight against the coronavirus pandemic is expected to continue through next year due to the emergence of variants, Dr. Stephen Hoge, president of Moderna, said during an earnings call earlier this month.\n\n\"We think this is just the beginning,\" Hoge said. \"Therefore, we're committed as a company to make as many updates to the vaccine, to add as many variants as we think are necessary, to ensure that when people receive a booster, it provides the broadest immune protection against the widest range of variants.\"\n\nJohnson & Johnson is also looking into the potential for boosters.\n\n\"We have ongoing and planned trials that will aid our assessment of the need for, and timing of, booster doses of our vaccine,\" according to an emailed statement Johnson & Johnson sent to CNN on Thursday.\n\nJohnson & Johnson's coronavirus vaccine, along with Pfizer's, Moderna's, and four others, are being tested as seasonal boosters in a study called Cov-Boost being conducted by the UK's National Institute for Health Research and the University of Southhampton.\n\n\"In the US, I think it will be the booster for everyone, particularly if we get it out late in the third quarter,\" Erck told CNN last week. \"It's going to be time to start boosting -- whether it's six months or at a year point.\"\n\nWho has to OK the Covid-19 booster shots?\n\nThe decision to use Covid-19 boosters is expected to involve two agencies -- the US Food and Drug Administration and the CDC -- and the regulatory process to get the shots into arms could vary depending on whether the booster is the same vaccine that was originally used or is a modified version.\n\n\"So, if it's the same vaccine, my understanding is that what would have to happen is that the CDC would have to recommend an additional dose with details around when that should occur,\" Moss said.\n\nIf it's a modified vaccine, \"this is where things get interesting and I don't think we quite know,\" he said, but added that the regulatory process could be similar to what happens with flu vaccines each year.\n\n\"Technically, whenever a vaccine like that is modified, it's often considered a new vaccine and has to go through the whole process again. But there is a precedent, obviously, with influenza virus vaccines, not to do that,\" Moss said. \"So, the influenza vaccine each year doesn't have to go through a large Phase 3 trial.\"\n\nThat's because the vaccine technology stays the same, and the only change is the flu virus itself that the vaccine targets to elicit immunity to a specific flu virus strain that's circulating.\n\nMoss said that's what he expects could happen with modified coronavirus vaccines.\n\n\"At this time, available information suggests that the FDA-authorized vaccines remain effective in protecting the American public against currently circulating strains of SARS-CoV-2. However, if there is an emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variant(s) in the U.S. that are moderately or fully resistant to the antibody response elicited by the current generation of COVID-19 vaccines, it may be necessary to tailor the vaccines to the variant(s),\" an FDA spokesperson told CNN on Thursday.\n\n\"Further discussions will be necessary to decide whether in the future, modified COVID-19 vaccines may be authorized without the need for clinical studies,\" according to the guidance. But overall, vaccine developers are \"encouraged\" to perform exploratory studies on modified vaccines to boost immune responses.","84":"Immensus Group, which owns and operates 16 Domino's Pizza stores in the Netherlands, is now offering its staff a part of their salary in bitcoin.\n\nAnnouncing the news on Bitcoin Pizza Day, Immensus said its employees can partly get paid in bitcoin. Partly because, according to Dutch laws, the minimum wage must be in euros.\n\nMore than 1,000 people will get exposure to bitcoin, Immensus Group co-owner Jonathan Gurevich told The Block. \"Part of these people work for us (16 Domino's Pizza stores and some restaurants), and part of these people work for our payroll companies,\" said Gurevich.\n\nImmensus wants to motivate its young staff, mostly school-going, to get familiar with the financial world with this initiative, Gurevich told The Block. The company also intends to retain and attract new staff, he said.\n\nImmensus has partnered with Dutch crypto broker BTC Direct for the effort, meaning BTC Direct will convert euros into bitcoin for Immensus's staff.\n\nThe bitcoin payment method is optional for eligible staff. Gurevich said that even if some employees learn about personal money management, \"we would already achieve something very important.\"\n\nBitcoin transaction costs will be borne by Immensus itself, said Gurevich.\n\nSince salaries only above a minimum wage would be qualified for bitcoin payments, those amounts would be negligible. \"For someone who works like 9 hours per week, they will be able to put at least put €5 per month into bitcoin,\" Gurevich told The Block. \"On average, people would be able to put €5 to €250 in bitcoin from their salaries,\" he said.\n\nBTC Direct also pays its employees a part of their salaries in bitcoin for the last three years.\n\nThe firm's current headcount is 80, and \"almost everybody\" has opted for the bitcoin payment option, BTC Direct's marketing manager Toon Schraven told The Block.\n\nBesides Immensus, BTC Direct is looking to work with more companies for the bitcoin salary option. Schraven said BTC Direct is \"closing some partnerships with a couple of major salary infrastructure companies\" but declined to name those firms as the deals are under process.\n\nMay 22 marks Bitcoin Pizza Day because, 11 years ago, on this day, bitcoin was used as a form of payment for the first time. A developer named Laszlo Hanyecz had bought two Papa John's pizzas with 10,000 bitcoin on May 22, 2010. Those bitcoins are worth now more than $385 million at the time of writing.","85":"AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc (NYSE: AMC) has announced that Chinese conglomerate Dalian Wanda Group Co. has sold off nearly all its shares in the U.S.-based theater company.\n\nWhat Happened: Wanda, which had been AMC's largest shareholder, sold off most of its shares on the open market. AMC now has some 3 million individual shareholders, and no single entity has an ownership stake above 10%, AMC said in its statement on Friday.\n\nAMC CEO Adam Aron credited Wanda with helping to make AMC the largest movie theater operator in the world.\n\nThe sale is part of a broader set of moves by Wanda. The conglomerate has been pulling back its sizable overseas investments after having paid high prices for many assets and now is struggling with a heavy load of debt.\n\nBut the sales though did come at a favorable time for Wanda. According to Deadline, the sales took place between May 13 and May 18 when they were trading for about $14 a share. Though AMC's share price dropped 11% in the past week, it still is up 501% year-to-date.\n\nWanda still holds 10,000 shares for a stake of just 0.002%. Wanda reported a 6.8% stake in April and a stake of more than a third of the company in October, according to Bloomberg.\n\nGameStop Saga Beneficiary: AMC was among the top other stocks targeted in the GameStop Corp (NYSE: GME) short squeeze drama that began unfolding in January. The moves led by the WallStreetBets Reddit group pushed up the price of targeted stocks and caused huge losses among short sellers that had bet against the stocks.\n\nWanda bought AMC in 2012 for $2.6 billion, and then took the company public in 2013, retaining a majority of the total outstanding shares.","86":"An analytics firm identified the bitcoin wallet used by the ransomware group behind the Colonial Pipeline attack and the massive payments received from victims.\n\nThe gang’s wallet received a 75 BTC (bitcoin) payment, or roughly $5 million, made by Colonial Pipeline on May 8 following the cyberattack on its operations, according to a report from blockchain analytics firm Elliptic.\n\nThe Colonial Pipeline shutdown led to widespread fuel shortages in the U.S. and has been described as the worst cyberattack on critical U.S. infrastructure to date. DarkSide, which the FBI confirmed as being behind the attacks, is believed to have originated in Eastern Europe, likely Russia. The group's ransomware was first spotted in August 2020.\n\nThe firm also tracked a ransomware bitcoin payment made by Brenntag, a large chemical distribution company in Germany, totaling roughly $ 4.4 million.\n\nThe group's wallet has been active since March 4, 2021, and has received 57 payments from 21 different wallets, according to Elliptic.\n\nIn total, the DarkSide wallet received Bitcoin transactions since March totaling $17.5 million, Elliptic said. The firm said the majority of the payment was moved out the wallet on May 9.\n\nA portion of the payments was sent to a small group of exchanges. One exchange was identified as Hydra, \"the world’s largest darknet marketplace, servicing customers in Russia and neighboring countries,\" according to Elliptic.\n\nHydra offers \"cash-out services\" along with narcotics, hacking tools and fake IDs, the report said.\n\n\"These allow Bitcoin to be converted into gift vouchers, prepaid debit cards or cash Rubles. If you’re a Russian cybercriminal and you want to cash-out your crypto, then Hydra is an attractive option,\" Elliptic said.\n\nDarkSide, which has since claimed it would cease operations, brought in a cool $90 million in just nine months from an estimated 47 victims, according to another report from Elliptic.\n\nSo far, 99 organizations have been infected with the DarkSide ransomware, \"suggesting that approximately 47% of victims paid a ransom, and that the average payment was $1.9 million,\" Elliptic said, citing a tweet by DarkTracer.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\nBecause of the large sums paid out by victims, ransomware has evolved into a big business that mirrors traditional business models.\n\nDarkSide is a prime example of Ransomware as a Service (RaaS), Elliptic said, echoing longstanding legitimate models such as SaaS or Software as a Service.\n\n\"In this operating model, the malware is created by the ransomware developer, while the ransomware affiliate is responsible for infecting the target computer system and negotiating the ransom payment with the victim organization,\" Elliptic said.\n\n\"This new business model has revolutionized ransomware, opening it up to those who do not have the technical capability to create malware, but are willing and able to infiltrate a target organization,\" according to the analytics firm.","87":"\n• Over a million bees were kept in a UPS truck for weeks due to problems with the packaging.\n• CBS Boston reported that most of the bees in the shipment died.\n• The bees were supposed to be shipped from Pennsylvania to New England, the report said.\n\nThe majority of about a million bees that were being shipped to New England died after they were kept for weeks inside a UPS truck in Shrewsbury, Massachusetts, according to CBS Boston.\n\nAccording to the report, the plan was for the bees to be shipped from a distributor in Pennsylvania, Mann Lake Ltd, to beekeepers in New England.

For the uninitiated, hot vax summer plays on the idea that once single Americans get their coronavirus vaccines, there will be a surge in dating, hookups and overall social opportunities due to all the pent-up demand. (You may also know it as shot girl summer.) Match Group's Hinge, Tinder, OKCupid, BLK, Chispa, Match and Plenty of Fish users will be able to share their vaccine status and get some premium benefits. Bumble and Badoo will also be able to note whether they're vaccinated, and receive some complementary credits. Bumble's and Match Group's latest earnings reports already indicated what all of the social media anecdotes are saying -- people want to hook up again. Though, Match executives put it another way in its letter to shareholders, calling this the \"summer of love.\" In its earnings release, Match said it anticipates total revenue of $680 million to $690 million in the second quarter. That would represent 22% to 24% year-over-year growth. Additionally, the company expects EBITDA of $255 million to $260 million this next quarter. \"The vaccination rates and control over the Covid cases these last few months have resulted in our users feeling more confident about their dating lives,\" Match CEO Shar Dubey said in a call with investors. Bumble estimates total revenue in the range of $175 million to $178 million for the second quarter, up 31% year-over-year at the midpoint of the range. That's also slightly better than analysts surveyed by Refinitiv expected, though some analysts considered it overly cautious. It also anticipates full year revenue in the range of $724 million to $734 million, raising its guidance. Bumble CEO Whitney Wolfe Herd told investors the company was seeing \"meaningful pent-up demand as economic and health improvements approve across regions.\" With a busy summer in mind, dating companies, like Match, Bumble and Grindr, are able to reap the benefits. \"We got a kick out of hot vax summer,\" Grindr's Director of Marketing Alex Black told CNBC. \"Activity is definitely up and we definitely expect that to increase going into the summer.\" It's not that people didn't use dating apps while isolating at home this past year. Despite the pandemic keeping people from in-person meetups, dating apps saw a jump in usage during lockdowns. Dating companies were able to shift their businesses to put an emphasis on virtual dating during the pandemic, so people could fill up their evenings with Zoom dates and phone calls. Bumble's first quarter revenue increased year-over-year to $170.7 million, up from $79.1 million for the first quarter of 2020. Analysts were expecting $164.6 million. Total paying users also increased 30% to 2.8 million. For its first quarter, Match reported adjusted earnings per share of 57 cents on revenue of $668 million. Analysts expected 40 adjusted EPS of 40 cents on revenue of $651 million. Average subscribers increased 12% to 11.1 million, up from 9.9 million in the prior year quarter. Daily average swipes were up 24%, daily average messages gained 19%, and conversations were 32% longer compared to the baseline period before Covid, Match said. Hinge is on pace to double its revenue in 2021. \"Stronger than expected 1Q21 results show growing momentum with reopening,\" Truist Securities analysts wrote in a recent note on dating apps.\n\nA reacceleration of the economy and a willingness to meet up with strangers again will likely push companies' growth even further, Jordana Abraham, co-host of the popular dating podcast \"U Up?\" told CNBC. Now that more than 270 million vaccine doses have been administered in the U.S., the people who took breaks from dating over the pandemic (tired of endless swiping or remote dating) are ready to get back out there. Often, an app is behind meet ups. \"People have felt this fear of being in physical contact with people, this fear of going out and meeting anyone new,\" Abraham said. \"And as people across the country start to get vaccinated, there's like something in the air. It's the sense of hopefulness, in the sense of, you know, the idea that they're going to be able to get back to that physical intimacy which so many people have been craving.\" Bumble told investors that it was already seeing signs of increased engagement in the U.S. People who had opted out of the app during the pandemic are starting to come back, and people who stayed are engaging even more. \"Of course people who took a break are definitely coming back,\" Grindr's Black said. The company is seeing growth among new users and a return of those who are logging back in for the first time in a while. Kathryn, a 27-year-old from Chicago, said she's been on-and-off of Hinge and Bumble since the pandemic restricted nearly all of the ways to meet people in person. (As she put it: \"at bars, at work, Uber Pools, the wine section of Target, etc.\"). Now that she's vaccinated, she's comfortable going on more dates that aren't virtual and is looking for casual relationships. \"I'm not looking to immediately reenter the world and settle into a serious relationship,\" Kathryn told CNBC in an email, asking that her last name not be used so she could speak freely about her dating life. \"I don't know if that's the common sentiment though. A lot of people may have realized after all this time alone at home that they'd like someone stable to be there if and when something like this happens again.\"\n\nIt's a similar story for Jordan, a 24-year-old from Boston. She's been using Hinge and Bumble, and had been seeking out a serious relationship before the pandemic. However, after spending a year living alone and becoming fully vaccinated, she said she's leaning more toward casual relationships, wanting to meet more people. Most places also still haven't returned to normal, so people are relying on apps to continue meeting people. \"Since my area is still re-opening, it feels like I'm in limbo, where I can go places but can't necessarily go to the types of events\/activities where I usually meet people (ex. bars, concerts) or COVID restrictions limit socialization at the places I can go (ex. local outdoor events, museums, gym),\" she said in an email. Bumble's Wolfe Herd told CNBC's \"TechCheck\" that as people come out of the pandemic, they've realized what they're looking for. Grindr is ramping up its marketing and advertising spend in anticipation of a return to normal. The company is also planning a handful of in-person events for later in the summer, going off of local health guidelines. Bumble may also boost its marketing spend, depending on pandemic recovery. Of course, it all depends on whether pandemic conditions continue to improve. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said fully vaccinated people no longer need to wear a face mask or stay six feet away from others in most settings, whether outdoors or indoors, which is a huge vote of confidence for singles. People don't want to just be protected against the coronavirus. A similar story has been playing out with U.S. condom sales this past quarter. Male condom sales dipped over the year, since fewer people were having sex, but now that restrictions are easing and people are vaccinated, sales are back up. Sales jumped 23.4% to $37 million during the four weeks ending April 18 compared year-over-year, according to the latest figures from market research firm IRI and reported by CNN. Trojan condom-maker Church & Dwight said 2021 could be \"promising\" for sales. Condoms are expected to deliver year-over-year growth as society opens up and consumers have greater mobility, the company's CEO Matthew Farrell said on an April 29 call with investors. Durex-maker Reckitt Benckiser said in its April 28 earnings report the segment delivered double-digit revenue growth in the quarter, led by strong growth in China due to an easing of social distancing restrictions. \"Looser 'stay at home' restrictions in China, compared to the first quarter of 2020, have for example, helped drive strong growth in our sexual wellbeing category. Over time, we would expect this recovery to be replicated in other markets where lockdowns have led to temporarily reduced demand,\" the company said.","91":"\n• Breeze Airways is finally taking to the skies with its first flight scheduled for May 27.\n• The airline's bases will be in Tampa, Florida; New Orleans, Louisiana; Norfolk, Virginia; and Charleston, South Carolina.\n• Flights will be mostly bare bones with Breeze charging extra for baggage and seat assignments.\n• See more stories on Insider's business page.\n\nAmerica has yet another brand new airline.\n\nJetBlue founder David Neeleman has taken the wraps off of his fifth airline venture after more than a year of waiting since it was first announced. Breeze Airways will finally start flights on May 27 and aims to put a \"seriously nice\" and tech-focused spin on ultra-low-cost flying just in time for the summer travel season.\n\nThe first flight will depart from Tampa, Florida bound for Charleston, South Carolina, and continue on to Hartford, Connecticut. It's the first of 39 routes that Breeze will launch between May 27 and July 22, connecting underserved cities throughout the US with non-stop flights to the places leisure travelers want to be.\n\nRead More: JetBlue founder David Neeleman reveals how his new airline can succeed by flying weird routes for low prices\n\nBut if followers of Neeleman are expecting a 2021-reboot of JetBlue, they'll be sadly mistaken. Breeze will operate under an ultra-low-cost business model where nearly everything from a seat assignment to checked baggage will cost extra. It's slated to be almost the complete opposite of JetBlue.\n\nHere's what travelers can expect from Breeze.\n\nA route network spanning from the Atlantic Ocean to San Antonio, Texas\n\nBreeze plans to take advantage of the leisure travel boom in the US by connecting smaller, underserved cities with non-stop flights to vacation and tourist destinations.\n\nThe cities of Tampa, Florida; Norfolk, Virginia; and New Orleans, Louisiana will be the first four bases for the airline from which most of its flights will either start or end.\n\nBetween New Orleans and:\n\nBreeze will also fly between many of the cities it serves outside of its four main bases. Those routes include:\n• Between Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and Hartford, Connecticut starting July 22; and\n\nBreeze plans to operate two types of aircraft this summer: the Embraer E190 and Embraer E195. Both are near-identical and will offer a lot of the same amenities but will differ in their seating arrangements.\n\nThe aircraft will only feature economy seats and will be split between standard legroom \"nice\" seats and extra-legroom \"nicer\" seats, which come at a premium.\n\nBreeze's smaller Embraer E190, which many JetBlue flyers will recognize, will carry 108 seats. Nice seats on the E190 will offer 29 inches of legroom, compared to JetBlue's 32 inches, and nicer seats will offer between 33 and 39 inches of legroom.\n\nThe larger Embraer E195 aircraft will carry 118 seats and legroom at each will be greater. Nice seats on the aircraft offer 31 inches of legroom while nicer seats will offer between 34 and 39.\n\nSeeking out the E195 aircraft won't be easy as there are only three of those aircraft versus 13 E190s.\n\nBreeze plans to charge incredibly cheap fares for its flights, and that means there will be lots of fees to pay for extras.\n\nFlyers will have to pay to bring a bag larger than a purse or backpack. The fees, however, are lower than most airlines charge at only $20, regardless of carrying on or checking a bag, but increase to $25 if the flight is longer than three hours.\n\nIf a bag is checked at the airport, it will incur a $50 fee. And another $50 fee will be charged if a bag is added by Breeze airport staff.\n\nSecuring an advance seat assignment will also incur a fee, with prices starting at $10. But there are no middle seats on Breeze's Embraer aircraft so those that don't pay up will either be assigned an aisle or window seat for free.\n\nFamilies with children under 12 can also select advance seats for free.\n\nPrinting a boarding pass at the airport will incur a $3 fee per customer and a $9 fee per customer if helped by Breeze airport staff.\n\nWhat won't incur a fee, however, are changes and cancellations. Breeze fares are fully changeable and cancelable up to 15 minutes before departure.\n\nTravelers that cancel a ticket will have up to 24 months to use its value.\n\nBreeze started a unique work-study to recruit its flight attendants that saw the airline partner with Utah Valley University and allow its online students to work as cabin crew. The degree-seeking students will work the airline's flights by day and take online classes by night.\n\nIn return, the students-turned-cabin-crew will earn $6,000 in tuition reimbursement, a monthly stupid of $1,200, and only have to work for 15 days out of the month, among other benefits. What they won't be given is a full-time job at Breeze at the end of their academic career, and will have to reapply for a full-time position or find work elsewhere.\n\nBut not all of Breeze's cabin crew will be students. The airline opened up the program to non-student applicants after lower than expected recruitment numbers.\n\nSara Nelson, president of the Association of Flight Attendants-CWA union, told Bloomberg that the program could pose safety issues due to the potential age of the applicants. Breeze's minimum age for hiring flight attendants is 18 years old.\n\nBut the airline stood by its flight attendant training program that has been approved by the Department of Transportation, saying that all of its flight attendants will be trained and capable of performing the required duties.\n\n\"If you're a fully trained flight attendant, you're a fully trained flight attendant,\" airline spokesperson Gareth Edmondson-Jones told Insider. \"It's not like if you're 18 years old, you can't be a flight attendant.\"\n\nEntertainment will be available through mobile devices\n\nBreeze aircraft will not feature the seatback screens for which Neeleman made JetBlue famous. But in-flight entertainment will still be offered through mobile devices, powered by Global Eagle.\n\nOn-demand television shows, games, and a real-time flight map will be offered. Live television will not be available.\n\nMore than 150 shows will be available to watch and content will be updated quarterly.\n\nIn-flight WiFi won't be available on Breeze's Embraer aircraft but the service will be offered in the fall on the airline's Airbus A220 aircraft.\n\nJetBlue is known for offering brand-name snacks and so will Breeze. Kind bars and Utz pretzels will both be served onboard but the airline hasn't said whether they'll be free of charge.\n\nBreeze has also not given any information on whether a drink service will be offered.\n\nFares will be low, but not the lowest\n\nBreeze is launching its first 39 routes with fares as low as $39. There's no competition on 95 percent of Breeze's routes so direct comparisons aren't available but other ultra-low-cost carriers routinely offer flights for lower fares.\n\nFrontier Airlines, for example, offers fares as low as $15 sometimes on its East Coast flights. Spirit Airlines similarly offers fares less than Breeze's introductory rates.\n\nAnd only a certain number of $39 fares will be available. Once they're gone, fares will jump depending on how many seats have been sold.","92":"McDonald’s has been hit with a $10 billion lawsuit by two companies owned by media mogul Byron Allen, alleging the fast-food giant has engaged in racial discrimination in its ad spending.\n\nThe lawsuit was filed Thursday in Los Angeles County Superior Court by Entertainment Studios Networks Inc. and Weather Group LLC, both of which are owned by Allen, who is Black.\n\nAmerica is changing faster than ever! Add Changing America to your Facebook or Twitter feed to stay on top of the news.\n\nEntertainment Studios owns 12 television networks and the Weather Group owns The Weather Channel and Local Now.\n\nThe complaint alleges “McDonald’s intentionally discriminated against Entertainment Studios and Weather Group through a pattern of racial stereotyping and refusals to contract,” in violation of federal and state law.\n\nThe lawsuit argues McDonald’s has refused to advertise on Entertainment Studios networks or The Weather Channel since Allen acquired the companies in 2018 even though the company “purchased significant advertising on similarly situated, white-owned networks.”\n\nThe complaint also says McDonald’s spends less than $5 million of its $1.6 billion annual television ad budget on Black-owned media, despite African Americans making up some 40 percent of its sales.\n\n“This is about economic inclusion of African American-owned businesses in the U.S. economy,” Allen said in a statement.\n\n“McDonalds takes billions from African American consumers and gives almost nothing back. The biggest trade deficit in America is the trade deficit between White corporate American and Black America, and McDonald’s is guilty of perpetuating this disparity,” he said.\n\nThe lawsuit was filed the same day McDonald’s said it would increase its national ad spending with Black-owned media from 2 percent to 5 percent by 2024. It will also boost ad spending on Hispanic, Asian American, female and LGBTQ-owned platforms.\n\nThe fast-food chain said it will “review and respond accordingly” to the lawsuit.\n\nNY TIMES ESTIMATES WEALTHY AMERICANS ARE REFUSING TO PAY $1.4T IN UNCOLLECTED TAXES\n\nTHE SUPREME COURT COULD DEAL A MAJOR BLOW TO MINORITY VOTERS\n\nBIDEN ADVISER REPORTEDLY SAYS WHITE HOUSE WILL START REPARATIONS TO BLACK COMMUNITY ‘NOW’\n\nWOMEN OF COLOR ARE TIPPING THE BALANCE OF POWER IN U.S. CITIES\n\nNEW POLL FINDS RECORD NUMBER OF AMERICANS IDENTIFY AS LGBT","93":"Animal Rebellion is stopping workers from accessing four sites across England using trucks, beacons and bamboo towers with people locked into concrete blocks at the base, said the climate and animal justice movement Saturday.\n\n\"We believe that putting pressure on one of the largest and most iconic corporations in the world, who are responsible for significant amounts of greenhouse gas emissions and deforestation, can have an impact,\" a spokesperson for Animal Rebellion, Alex Lockwood, told CNN over the phone Saturday. The group is asking McDonald's to transition to a plant-based food system to \"stop the climate crisis and end the suffering of animals\" it said in a statement\n\nThe activists plan to blockade the distribution centers for at least 24 hours, but will try to stay for 48, said Lockwood. The bamboo structures will be difficult for police and workers to remove because of the protesters locked into the base.\n\nAnimal Rebellion has parked trucks outside the centers with messages attached reading \"Meat & Dairy = Climate Crisis\" and \"Plant-Based Food System.\" The blockade will affect around 1,300 restaurants and 3.5 million customers, according to the activist group.\n\n\"We want to shine a spotlight on the hypocrisy of the sustainability measures of McDonald's, and how they claim to have science-backed emissions targets while ignoring how unrealistic they are when they continue to serve the menu they serve,\" said Harley McDonald-Eckersall, a 23-year-old who volunteers full-time with Animal Rebellion. \"We want to open up a conversation with them.\" Protesters gathered outside four distribution centers across England, some dressed as Ronald McDonald, the fast-food chain's mascot. McDonald-Eckersall began protesting at a McDonald's distribution center at Hemel Hempstead, a town northwest of London, at 5 a.m. local time (midnight ET). Police arrived on the scene around three hours later, McDonald-Eckersall told CNN, but she added the atmosphere was \"very relaxed.\" McDonald's exec: The food industry needs to act now to cut greenhouse gas emissions We've had really positive conversations with workers, lots of them taking selfies with the clown car and big burger, so that's been enjoyable,\" she said. \"People are open to hearing why we're here.\" Animal Rebellion, a sister group to the environmental movement Extinction Rebellion, has not yet heard from McDonald's, McDonald-Eckersall said. The American corporation said its distribution centers were facing disruption. \"We are assessing the impact on deliveries to our restaurants and to menu items,\" a McDonald's spokesperson told CNN. \"We apologise to our customers for any disappointment caused.\" Bamboo towers blocked distribution centers which serve 3.5 million customers, according to Animal Rebellion. The spokesperson declined to say whether McDonald's would open a dialogue with Animal Rebellion. McDonald's expects to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 150 million tons by 2030 and co-founded the Global Roundtable for Sustainable Beef in 2011, which aims to improve the sustainability of the global beef supply chain. Francesca DeBlase, head of McDonald's global supply chain, wrote in a CNN opinion piece in September that reducing emissions has to be the food industry's \"number one priority.\" Police have also arrived at the other protest sites at distribution centers in Basingstoke, Coventry and Heywood, said Lockwood. Workers tried to remove activists at the Heywood plant, but police are now keeping the situation calm there, he added.","94":"\n• A dozen current and former Oracle employees say there is a \"culture of fear\" at its flagship cloud unit.\n• Cloud boss Clay Magouyrk sometimes tries to get results by \"beating down\" employees emotionally, they say.\n• OCI, the cloud unit, has lost at least a dozen VPs since the start of 2020, and is facing lawsuits.\n• See more stories on Insider's business page.\n\nIn May 2017, Oracle executive Clay Magouyrk was presenting at a livestreamed all-hands meeting for the database giant's nascent cloud unit when he ran into a problem with his laptop. The attendees who spoke with Insider said that while they each remember a slightly different version of Magouyrk's exact wording, the gist of his frustrated aside was that the laptop must've been built by \"tiny Asian hands.\"\n\nThe day after the meeting, executive Don Johnson — who at the time was Magouyrk's boss and the overall leader of Oracle's cloud business — apologized in an email reviewed by Insider for \"not stepping in\" during what he characterized as \"inappropriate commentary.\"\n\n\"We at Sparta pride ourselves on being progressive, unfiltered, and bucking the trend of typical corporate America,\" Johnson wrote in a copy of the email reviewed by Insider. Sparta was, at the time, the codename for Johnson's unit, meant to evoke the imagery of a small-but-mighty team bent on overtaking Amazon Web Services, the dominant cloud platform.\n\n\"The comments made yesterday do not reflect my own views on how we should be leading our organization and will not be exhibited by my management team going forward,\" Johnson wrote, and pledged to bring on executive coaches for his team.\n\nUltimately, however, when Johnson stepped aside last summer to lead new projects at Oracle, Magouyrk was appointed to take over Sparta, now called Oracle Cloud Infrastructure — a unit of over 10,000 employees that people close to the company say brings in around a billion dollars per year in revenue. In March, the company said that it booked $10.1 billion in revenue for the most recent quarter. However, it doesn't disclose specific revenue for cloud units including OCI, and only said that OCI grew 100% over the same period of 2020.\n\nMagouyrk, a former Amazon software development engineer who joined Oracle as an individual contributor in 2014, quickly impressed Oracle Chairman Larry Ellison and CEO Safra Catz with his ability to deliver results quickly, leading to his rapid ascent through the ranks to preside over Oracle Cloud Infrastructure.\n\nThe reign of Magouyrk, however, has raised questions over Oracle's culture. Magouyrk's leadership style was cited in a pair of lawsuits filed by former VPs against the company and an executive, including an allegation that he once told an executive that his actions were \"fucking stupid\" in front of all of OCI's senior leaders. One of the former VPs who sued Oracle died by suicide in April. Oracle is seeking to force both cases into private arbitration.\n\nOracle insiders who spoke to Insider said the comments alleged in the lawsuit are generally \"tame\" compared to others Magouyrk has made. Magouryk was \"abusive to people in large group settings. It was never, 'stay after the meeting and let's have a conversation.' If he was upset, he would insult you personally and professionally,\" one former employee said. \"He'd drive grown men to tears, and then just be like, 'Jesus fucking Christ.'\"\n\nAll told, a dozen current and former Oracle employees and executives said there was what one person described as a \"culture of fear\" at OCI, telling Insider that Magouyrk is known for trying to get results by \"beating down\" employees emotionally. One employee said they were told during the interview process that they were going to want a \"fear buddy\" to turn to when they inevitably thought they were going to get fired.\n\nMagouyrk has had a meteoric rise at Oracle, promoted from an individual contributor to an executive vice president within about six years. But insiders charge that Magouyrk has failed to develop the management skills necessary to run a business of OCI's size. And since 2020, Oracle Cloud Infrastructure has lost at least a dozen vice presidents, including former senior vice president of software engineering Rahul Patil and former senior vice president Steve Daheb. Insiders believe at least some of the attrition is attributable to the culture created by Magouyrk.\n\nMagouyrk's behavior has so far been tolerated, according to insiders, because he won over Ellison and Catz by building what is arguably Oracle's single most important business, representing the core of the database giant's ongoing efforts to reposition itself as a cloud computing heavyweight, with Ellison repeatedly slamming market leader Amazon Web Services in public. Oracle's cloud ambitions came to the forefront last year when it signed a key customer deal with Zoom , and won the bid to host TikTok's infrastructure in the US (though that deal fell through).\n\n\"Larry trusts Clay because Don and Clay built OCI,\" one person said. Magouyrk is \"selling OCI as the future to Larry and Safra,\" another said. Oracle declined to comment on Magouyrk's management style or OCI's culture. Magouyrk and Johnson did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nMagouyrk joined Oracle in July 2014 as an individual contributor, having worked the previous six years as a software development engineer at Amazon.\n\nAt the time, Oracle was just entering the cloud infrastructure business, under the leadership of long-time executive Thomas Kurian — once considered a leading candidate to one day take the company over as CEO. Kurian did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nEarly on, Oracle made an acquisition Kurian hoped would help reinvigorate Oracle's lagging cloud business.\n\nBut it wasn't a good fit, two former executives said. The acquired product was designed for corporations to build a very small-scale cloud, and Oracle was trying to \"shoehorn\" it into the platform to make it work for large enterprise customers, the executives said. \"Customers hated it,\" one person said.\n\nIn the end, Ellison decided that Kurian's vision wasn't living up to expectations as an AWS rival, and tapped Magouyrk and Johnson — a former Amazon principal engineer who joined in 2014 as Oracle's senior director of engineering — to lead the charge on creating a \"second-generation\" cloud from scratch.\n\nMagouyrk, who was Johnson's first hire at Oracle, impressed Ellison early on with what he was able to accomplish with a small and nimble team. At Oracle, the production cycle for the first version of a new cloud feature could take six months; Magouyrk's team was able to cut it down to two weeks.\n\n\"Larry would say something, and Clay would say, 'We can make that happen,'\" one former senior-level employee said. \"He impressed Larry with his ability to deliver, even though the way he did it was by being incredibly aggressive and beating up on people.\"\n\nThe rise of Sparta led to infighting at Oracle\n\nThe new group was codenamed \"Draco\" and later renamed \"Sparta.\" Modeled after AWS, where Johnson and Magouyrk both previously worked, the group created a set of leadership principles modeled on Amazon's. A copy of the \"OCI values\" reviewed by Insider included principles like \"put customers first,\" \"don't be a jerk,\" and \"own without ego.\" The group filled out its ranks of so-called Spartans by poaching engineers largely from AWS.\n\nThe rise of the OCI also caused rifts within Oracle — the legacy of which can still be felt today. Kurian, who was still leading the first-generation cloud that had been internally re-dubbed \"Oracle Classic,\" started a rivalry with the new Sparta group. One person said Kurian at one point pressured Accenture to choose Oracle Classic instead of what would become OCI. Accenture did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nFinally, in the summer of 2018, Ellison issued a decree: Johnson would be given overall control of the cloud business, while Kurian would oversee the rest of Oracle's products. Kurian left in the immediate aftermath of that decision, according to two people familiar with the situation, with one describing it as a \"rage quit.\" Kurian was named CEO of Google Cloud later that year, replacing Diane Greene. Google did not comment for this story.\n\nThe decision effectively made Magouyrk the second-in-command of Oracle's cloud business, with one former employee describing Johnson as the \"mature older statesman\" who kept his outburst-prone protege in check. Once, a former employee walked out of Magouryk's office after a screaming match, according to someone who witnessed the meeting, and quit. Johnson, whose office was next door, marched into Magouyrk's office and said: \"You need to get him back or you're done,\" according to the employee. The person who quit did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nInsiders say that Magouyrk gained a reputation among some for being generally difficult to work with: In 2016, Oracle acquired the startup Dyn and integrated into a group overseen by Magouyrk. Three months after the deal closed, Dyn's leadership made it clear that it would not work with Magouyrk, with Oracle eventually reassigning it to Johnson's direct command.\n\nNonetheless, in June, Johnson told employees that he was stepping down from direct leadership of OCI to pursue new projects within Oracle, with Magouyrk tapped to replace him.\n\nNow in command of OCI, Magouyrk was able to place his own stamp on the organization — to the chagrin of at least some employees.\n\nMany of Magouyrk's alleged outbursts happened during weekly meetings, held on Fridays, sources said. The \"operations meeting\" usually has between 60 to 100 employees dialed in to go over the previous week's events. The \"critical projects\" meeting on the same day includes a smaller group of executives. During that meeting, Magouyrk reviews a packet with 50 or so pages, with each page or two representing a different leader with the status of a critical project.\n\nEach project is marked with red, yellow, or green, signifying whether the project is on track, according to a packet viewed by Insider. Completed projects appear in blue. \"Clay sometimes accuses you of being a 'watermelon,' or green on the outside and red on the inside,\" one person said.\n\nThe worst thing you can be in Magouyrk's eyes is late, people who have worked for him said. \"He says things like 'Why is the fuck is this late? Every single week you're slipping. Do you have a fucking clue what you're doing?,' one person said.\n\nAfter a big disagreement or incident, sources say Magouyrk sometimes reassigns an executive to be an individual contributor working on a low-priority \"special project.\" That executive's organization gets reassigned to another leader.\n\nThe lawsuits filed by the former VPs allege Oracle executive Tony Grayson, who reported to Magouyrk, \"actively insulted people\" and changed dates to impress his boss \"even though the team had told him these dates were unreachable, and then would tell the team they were failing when they could not meet those dates.\" As Insider previously reported, Oracle appears to have reassigned Grayson to \"focus on key data center innovation and architecture-related projects.\"\n\nMagouyrk's type of management style can be effective in some respects, but only to a point, former employees say.\n\n\"To a point, the fear culture is helpful because people really do push themselves — the internal joke at OCI is Microsoft is a country club,\" one former executive said, referring to the perception that Microsoft provides more work-life balance than other companies, but may not be as ambitious. \"But beyond that point, fear doesn't work. Fear just means people cover things up. They go watermelon.\"\n\nNotably, Johnson returned to OCI in December, starting a new cloud and artificial intelligence organization that he described in an email to employees as \"an extension of OCI, not a division of it.\" Magouyrk continues to lead OCI \"proper\" under the new structure. Oracle's internal organizational chart, viewed by Insider, shows that Johnson now oversees about one-third of OCI employees. Oracle declined to comment on the unit's structure.\n\nMagouyrk may not be what Oracle needs to win the cloud wars\n\nOCI's culture can also translate over to the unit's dealings with customers, insiders say.\n\nFor instance, OCI established a program called FairShare. A 2019 document viewed by Insider describes FairShare as a \"limit to protect customers from bursty workloads.\"\n\nBut one person with direct knowledge of the program characterized it differently, saying it is a list of customers to which Oracle had previously given big discounts in exchange for positive marketing testimonials or other services, but to whom it now regretted giving those discounts. When those customers attempt to launch new computers on Oracle's cloud, it will sometimes return an \"out of capacity error,\" and allow another customer who pays full price to use those resources, the person said. A person close to Oracle's operations disputes this characterization, though, saying that its capacity management systems ensure \"equal\" distribution of resources that doesn't favor any customers over others.\n\n\"One of the challenges for Oracle is perception and reputation,\" Futurum Research analyst Daniel Newman said. \"The company is aggressively working to overcome what can sometimes be classified as being difficult to do business with despite having more than 400,000 customers and being on a steady stream of growth in its cloud and [software-as-a-service] endeavors.\"\n\nOracle's \"first generation cloud simply missed the mark,\" Newman said. \"It wasn't competitive with the likes of AWS and Azure,\" but its second-generation cloud has been much better and yielded high-profile customer wins and \"encouraging growth.\" Newman also noted the company has yet to clearly break out on the revenue numbers for its public cloud business.\n\nInsiders say the cloud unit will need a more sophisticated, seasoned operator. Perhaps ironically, one former executive points to the success that Kurian has seen in turning around Google Cloud in the years since he left Oracle. Kurian has proven to be an effective leader and salesperson, increasing Google's appeal to larger customers and making it more competitive.\n\n\"They need a Thomas Kurian,\" one former executive said of Oracle. Without someone like that, the former executive said, Oracle's cloud ambitions could be in jeopardy.\n\n\"Something is going to go wrong enough that they are not going to be able to shove it into the closet or sweep it under the rug,\" the person said. \"They are going to run out of people to take the fall and they are going to have to hire somebody.\"\n\nDo you work at Oracle or have insight to share?

Tens of thousands of bright, shiny, never-been-driven Ford (F) and GM (GM) trucks and SUVs.\n\nThey appear to be ride ready, but they aren’t. Buyers are lined up to buy them, but they can’t. The problem, as you might have guessed, is the vehicles have no chips.\n\nAnd so these cars and trucks wait in purgatory, more than $1 billion worth of them*, washed by the rain and glistening in the spring sun, a silent testament to the global chip shortage brought about by unprecedented COVID-19 conditions and some ill-advised decisions, as well.\n\nThe pandemic of course forced thousands of small businesses around the world to close. It gut punched the airline, hotel and cruise ship businesses. Commercial real estate was socked too. At the same time, the likes of Zoom, Peloton, Big Tech and the rest of the stay-at-home economy went to the moon, as they say. Those trends and outcomes — both positive and negative — were pretty readily predicted and recognized by this time last year.\n\nFew saw, however, what would happen to the semiconductor and auto industries. Before I get into what transpired and our path forward, a quick word or two about just how bad the situation is.\n\nHow bad is it Andy?\n\nSo bad that if you are shopping for a pickup and looking for a specific make or model right now, forget it. You'll be lucky if the dealer has much of anything. Billionaire Jeffrey Gundlach recently told Yahoo Finance’s Julia LaRoche he wanted to buy a new truck but had to settle for a used one. “According to Gundlach, the truck he purchased had 8,000 miles on it, but was only $2,000 less than the sticker price of a brand new truck.” No deals for billionaires even. Used car prices, by the way, are soaring, up 10.0% in April and 21% over the last 12 months.\n\nHow bad is it? So bad that old-timers are scratching their heads. Usually the problem for a car dealer is too many cars and not enough customers. Now, it’s the opposite. Last Saturday I spoke with a dealer in New Jersey who’s been in the business for 40 years. (He wanted to remain anonymous so as not to get HQ peeved.) \"When was the last time, you’ve seen a shortage of cars like this,\" I asked? “Never,” he told me shaking his head, “not even close.” That explains why a few minutes earlier the dealer’s eyes had lit up when I drove in to return my leased 2017 Escape. “I can use that car,” he had said hungrily.\n\nHow bad is it? So bad that GM is scrapping fuel-saving technology that requires chips on certain V8-powered Silverado and Sierra pickups. Meaning essentially that these trucks are devolving. So bad that Ford is cutting back and or halting production at eight assembly plants in North America that make Mustangs, Escapes, the popular new Bronco, oh and the F-150 pickup, the best selling vehicle in America. This of course on the heels of the rollout of its all-electric F-150, replete with a test drive by President Biden. (EVs need the same or more chips, in case you were wondering.) Ford now says the debacle will cost it some $2.5 billion in earnings this year.\n\nSo bad that workers at auto plants are being told to stay home and it’s maybe even affecting the economic recovery. I spoke with U.S. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo on Thursday and asked her if that was in fact the case.\n\n“In part, yes, absolutely,” she told me. “If you just take the auto industry, which is obviously a very, very important industry with a lot of jobs, but just in that one industry, we have thousands of folks furloughed right now. And that's true in other industries as well. So yes, absolutely.”\n\nIt’s so bad that it could end up costing the U.S. auto industry $110 billion, according to AlixPartners, an industry consulting group.\n\nSo bad that Detroit has added a new phrase to the automaking lexicon, “build-shy,” which is when a carmaker builds a vehicle just shy of completion, (i.e., without the chips), to keep the factories working and jobs in place. (All those cars in those aforementioned lots are “built shy.”)\n\nIt’s so bad that President Biden has been on the case for months (to no avail) and so bad that Raimondo is working it nearly full time, meeting with auto and chip executives trying to craft a solution.\n\n“This is a real problem,” Raimondo acknowledged. “Ford is going to be down over a million cars this year. Look at the price of used cars. Used car prices are through the roof. Why? Because this is a shortage of new cars. Why? Because they can't get their hands on enough semiconductors. So the ripple effects throughout our economy because of semiconductor shortages are extensive.”\n\nSo we have auto shortages and billions of dollars of car sales lost, prices gone bananas for used cars and thousands of jobs at risk. What the hell happened? Well, COVID yes, but executives made some bad calls too. That plus over-dependence on a fragile and non-U.S.-based supply chain.\n\nBefore I get into detail there, you should know that electronics, (i.e., mostly chips) now account for some 40% of a car’s cost, up from 18% in 2000. “The microprocessors and chips that power modern vehicles are now so prevalent that they're practically a commodity in the same vein as steel and aluminum,” according to Car and Driver. “Computers are used in everything from the mundane (such as basic trip computers) to the near magical (think road-scanning active suspensions). They've made cars quicker, safer, cleaner, more efficient, and more reliable—better in every way.” (There are a number of other great stats and graphics about the auto business and chips in this Deloitte report beginning on page 12.)\n\nAnd now for the tick-tock on exactly what happened to the auto industry that put them in this pickle. For an explanation here I’ll turn it over to our tech writer extraordinaire, Dan Howley, from this article.\n\n“Right now [automakers] are competing in the supply base with phones, and notebook computers,” Willy Shih, professor of management practice in business administration at Harvard Business School, told Yahoo Finance. “Apple (AAPL) will sell more iPhones in the first three months of this year than all the automakers combined will sell vehicles in the whole year. So then if you're a semiconductor maker who's the more important customer?”\n\nA big problem here is that most chips are made overseas, with the U.S. now accounting for only some 12% of chip capacity, a point not lost on Raimondo. “So yes, we're 12%. We want to get ourselves back up to 25% plus,” she told me. “Within the 12%, if you look at what they call bleeding-edge, the most sophisticated chips, right now we're at 0%. And so that's an area where we want to really invest, so we get ourselves to a place where we can meet our demand in, say, 10 or 12 years.”\n\nThat will take investment. Senator Chuck Schumer wants to allocate $52 billion towards this shortage as part of the Endless Frontier Act. I asked Raimondo if that was enough.\n\n“(While] I would urge Congress to pass that as swiftly as possible, I don't think anyone thinks $50 billion is enough to solve the problem,” she said. “But this is the beginning of a long term journey. And the hope would be that that $50 billion would unlock another $50 billion and $100 billion or more from the private sector, which in total would be really very meaningful in order for us to make chips in America and regain our tech leadership in the most sophisticated chips.”\n\nShould the automakers change their chip inventory practices going forward, I ask? Should they hold more in reserve? Is there too much just-in-time inventory being practiced?\n\n“I think that the answer is yes,” Raimondo told me. “I have been talking to them about that topic. I think there is broad recognition across industries, that there needs to be a reexamination of supply chain. Strategies, as you said, just-in-time, may need to be adjusted. Having said that, we don't want any hoarding of chips. There is a lot of discussion around where all the chips are going? So I think, yes, there needs to be reexamination of supply chain strategies. But also, there needs to be a lot more transparency in the supply chain, in order for suppliers to meet the demand.”\n\nForget about us building up bleeding-edge chip capacity in 2030. Even just getting back to normal inventory levels will take months. Some say in the fall, some say next spring. And while we know COVID-related disruptions will abate soon enough, bigger issues, like relying on overseas partners that don’t share our goals, and the decline of manufacturing in the U.S., even when it comes to the highest of high tech like chip fabrication, remain.\n\nThere’s enough blame to go around when it comes to auto executives not realizing that COVID would actually create a spike in demand for autos. To be fair though that was not an obvious call.\n\nLess forgivable perhaps is squeezing every last nickel out of the supply chain, which is actually a stakeholder capitalism issue. How is that exactly? Think about it. At whose behest really is the supply chain being squeezed? For the bottom line, i.e., the shareholder. The automakers, and others, stretched supply chain lines to the limit, to please investors. Now that the supply chain is broken, who pays the price? Employees (furloughed) and customers (no trucks, no SUVs.)\n\nIf supply chains were not designed to minimize cost and instead to maximize reliability and even to prioritize domestic supply (which would boost jobs in the U.S.), this debacle wouldn’t have happened or certainly not to this degree.\n\nRaimondo is right. It is a long journey. Let’s hope we’re setting off on it now. So do the furloughed auto workers and the buyers of all those trucks and SUVs parked in Mexico, Missouri and Kentucky, sitting idle, waiting to be started.\n\n*There are easily 25,000 cars, trucks and SUVs sitting in limbo and with the average light vehicle now costing $40,857, that gets you to $1 billion.\n\nThis article was featured in a Saturday edition of the Morning Brief on May 22, 2021.

This was on a New York to San Francisco flight, and the passenger was seated in JetBlue’s Mint business class.\n\nThis incident came to light because a reader was on the flight, and recorded a video of the captain standing in the cabin after the plane diverted to Minneapolis, providing a mighty detailed account of events that caused the diversion.\n\nThere are now a lot more details about what happened, as a criminal complaint has been filed against 42 year old Mark Scerbo. He is being charged with one count of possession of cocaine, which carries a maximum of three years in prison and a minimum fine of $5,000. He had 24.5 grams of cocaine on him at the time of the diversion (which he claimed was creatine).\n\nI imagine he’ll also face a significant fine and\/or possibly jail time with the FAA’s new zero-tolerance policy for poor inflight behavior, but that’s not part of this complaint.\n\nThis document contains even more details of what allegedly happened on that flight, and my gosh it’s wild. Here are the highlights of what’s being claimed:\n• During the meal service, the passenger threw his food on the floor, grabbed a metal butter knife, and began walking up and down the aisle while holding the knife in a closed fist with the blade up\n• When the flight attendant removed the passenger’s meal tray, she observed a bag containing a white powdery substance\n• The passenger sang out loud, did yoga-like movements in people’s faces, and acted aggressively\n• The passenger told his seatmate that he was a prophet named Genghis Khan, accused her of being in the CIA, and said he loved her; he talked to her about nano bots, angels, and a “peace army”\n• When the passenger’s seatmate asked him if he was on drugs, he replied “of course not, look me in the third eye”\n• The passenger went to the bathroom at least six times, sometimes bringing a butter knife and a large feather; at one point he was even seen snorting the substance at his seat, and getting it all over his mustache, face, and pants\n• The seatmate was reseated because she didn’t feel safe, but then the passenger walked by her and patted her on the head\n• When the passenger tried to get the attention of someone else in the cabin and was ignored, he repeatedly called him a “f*ggot,” and then threw playing cards at him while saying “suicide kings”\n\nAlso, one important point of clarification. When being questioned by authorities in Minneapolis, the man clarified that he claimed to be Toshi Nakamoto, the founder of a crypto currency, and not Genghis Khan. I’m inclined to believe him on that front, because when I was reading the complaint in regards to what he was talking about to his seatmate, I thought to myself “there’s no way he wasn’t talking about crypto.”\n\nThis isn’t the guy’s first drug-related run in with the law:\n• He had a prior federal conviction for conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute a controlled substance, and was sentenced to 57 months in jail\n• He was sentenced to an additional four months in jail for a supervised release violation\n• He was convicted of introducing drugs into prison, and was sentenced to an additional 18 months in jail\n\nWhat a story this is. When the flight diverted, the captain provided a play-by-play of what happened, in a way I’ve never seen done before. While his description ended up being pretty accurate (even though he was on the other side of the cockpit door), I’d say reality was even wilder.\n\nI feel sorry for all the other passengers on the flight, as this must have been a legitimately scary situation. I hope this guy gets the help he needs, and isn’t allowed to terrorize passengers on another flight anytime soon.","97":"After Oregon's catastrophic wildfire season in 2020, the state has already started preparing for the worst.\n\nPortland General Electric (PGE) did this for the first time ever last summer, cutting power to an area near Mt. Hood in response to the extreme fire danger and high winds forecasted for Labor Day.\n\nIt seemed to work. No fires broke out in that area.\n\nBut that certainly wasn't the case for other parts of Oregon. In 2020, more than a million acres burned statewide.\n\nAn incident report says downed power lines sparked at least 13 fires in the Santiam Canyon, which eventually merged with the devastating Beachie Creek Fire.\n\nFire victims sued Pacific Power, claiming the power company kept their powerlines energized despite being warned about extreme fire weather. Those lawsuits are still working their way through the court system.\n\nIn Lane County, fire victims are also suing two utility companies over last summer's Holiday Farm Fire that broke out east of Eugene. They claim tree branches sparked when they touched powerlines, and that grew into a massive fire. The official cause is still under investigation.\n\nLawsuits like these are something utility companies want to avoid in the future.\n\nIn anticipation of another potentially bad season in Oregon, the state has set some regulations around preemptive power shutoffs.\n\nAccording to temporary new rules, utility companies will have the final say on whether they will cut power, but they will have to notify the public – especially vulnerable populations that could be impacted by an outage. They also must report any fire that sparks from their equipment to the state.\n\nPlanned power shutoffs have become more frequent in California as its wildfire seasons have gotten worse in recent years.","98":"For the past week, a reckoning around sexism has gripped the craft beer industry.\n\nIt began with a question, posed May 11 by Massachusetts brewer Brienne Allan on her Instagram to fellow women in the business. “What sexist comments have you experienced?” she asked.\n\nAllan received a flood of responses: more than a thousand accounts of alleged misogyny, racism and sexual misconduct from women across the country who work within the “boys’ club” of craft brewing. The accounts quickly garnered national attention. The fallout from the accusations has already unseated several prominent industry players, from San Diego to Pennsylvania.\n\nThe reckoning has also, inevitably, reached Vermont’s tight-knit craft beer scene.\n\nSeveral anonymous testimonials that Allan posted on Instagram described first- and secondhand accounts of misogynistic behavior by Shaun Hill, the founder of Hill Farmstead Brewery in Greensboro. Allan herself said that she was told that Hill had made a degrading comment about her two years ago.\n\nHill is a star in Vermont brewing. For years, Hill Farmstead has ranked among the best breweries in the nation. His establishment draws crowds of beer aficionados to rural Greensboro Bend in the Northeast Kingdom. And he’s one of many high-profile men in the beer industry who are now implicated in the testimonials.\n\nVTDigger was not able to independently corroborate the allegations against Hill, and Allan has maintained that she “does not vouch” for the accuracy of individual stories she has shared, most of which she received via Instagram messages. (Allan did not return an interview request.)\n\nBut the sea of stories, Allan told Good Beer Hunting, has still proved “liberating” for many in the beer industry who have experienced abuse. “People are listening,” she said.\n\nInitially, Hill provided a lengthy statement to VinePair in response to the allegations. “I surely have a different perspective on what has been shared both overtly and anonymously,” he wrote, “but what matters is how each person sees it.”\n\nStill, he continued, “I have never acted in a manner that was openly, willingly or consciously dismissive, degrading or threatening.” The statement, critics noted, did not include an apology or an acknowledgement of wrongdoing.\n\nReached Friday by VTDigger, Hill maintained that “these things did not happen the way that they were perceived to happen.” He emphasized that most of the testimonials Allan shared were secondhand accounts — “a game of telephone.” As for the comment he allegedly made about her, he said, “I did not say these words.”\n\nUltimately, when pressed on whether he planned to apologize, Hill said, “I am sorry. I am not a perfect human being.” He added that he was “committed to participating in changing the beer industry.”\n\nThe accounts have rippled beyond Hill and across Vermont’s craft beer scene. On Wednesday, Rochester restaurant Maple Soul, known for its beer selection, announced it would no longer sell products from breweries implicated in the allegations. Others, including the Alchemist brewery in Stowe, have put out statements in support of those coming forward.\n\nWomen in Vermont’s brewing industry say the reckoning this month has brought needed attention to a longstanding problem.\n\nFor Jen Kimmich, co-founder of the Alchemist, the many testimonials Allan shared resonated with her, after nearly three decades in the beer business.\n\n“So many of the stories I’ve read were so much like my own story,” she said. “Being overlooked because I’m a woman. Being pressured by bosses. Being disrespected. I’ve experienced all of that.”\n\nBut visible in the testimonials, Kimmich said, was a sense of camaraderie that was absent when she was breaking into the industry. She was “absolutely in awe” reading them. “This is the first time I have felt really hopeful for young women in craft beer,” Kimmich said. “I am so relieved that things are shifting.”\n\nNo one is surprised, though, about the content of the accusations Allan shared, which range from degrading comments to sexual assault.\n\n“We’re at a turning point,” said Elise Pecor, general manager and partner at Vermont Pub and Brewery.\n\nPecor says she believes misogyny in brewing — while not specific to beer — is fueled by the power dynamics at play in the industry, which has turned brewers like Hill into minor celebrities.\n\n“When you combine that inflated ego with alcohol and flat-out bad character, you get men who feel like they can get away with anything,” she said. “Especially when the community is lacking diversity.”\n\n“I wish I could say to you that it were shocking. It’s most certainly appalling. But it’s not at all shocking,” said Jen Huntington, co-owner of Maple Soul. The restaurant’s decision not to stock products from implicated breweries, she said, was the “best thing that we could do.”\n\n“We’ve been looking for a voice, we’ve been looking for someone to pay attention for years,” Huntington said. “So I’m thrilled that this is picking up steam.”\n\n“We’re not immune here in Vermont,” said Melissa Corbin, executive director of the Vermont Brewers’ Association. Corbin, whose organization represents more than 60 breweries across the state, says she has heard similar accounts from women in the past.\n\nOn Friday, Corbin said, she reached out to brewery employees throughout Vermont, offering to listen to their stories. It was just the first step, she said, before further action.\n\n“It’s heavy,” she said. “But I’m so glad we’re having this conversation.”","99":"","100":"Plug Power (PLUG) closed at $27.89 in the latest trading session, marking a +1.53% move from the prior day.

During the briefing, Foot Locker Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Richard “Dick” Johnson, shared a number of figures that exceeded projections coming into 2021. Alongside news that revenue increased 82% year-over-year (to $2.15 billion) and that Foot Locker’s digital business grew 43% on a comparable company analysis, a report regarding the future of remaining Footaction retail locations was shared.\n\nAcquired by the umbrella company in 2004, Footaction has historically served as Foot Locker’s lifestyle-oriented counterpart. Although both shops carried mutual products, the former also stocked Nike Dunk and other Nike Sportswear classics. Over the last decade, the 45-year-old brand noticeably transitioned from a “boutique” experience to one that focused on performance basketball. All throughout the country, Footaction locations have been expanded to include Flight 23, a segment dedicated to the Air Jordan line and wider Brand Jordan range of products similar to Foot Locker’s House of Hoops endeavor.\n\n“We are currently in the process of assessing the Footaction fleet to determine the best decision for each location,” said Johnson during the call. “Approximately one third of the top performance Footaction locations will be made into new Foot Locker stores establishing a bolder women’s and kids presence, as well as new Champ Sports and Kids Foot Locker stores.

(AP) — Amazon has temporarily shut down a new warehouse construction site in Connecticut after a seventh noose was found hanging over a beam, a series of incidents local police called “potential” hate crimes.\n\nAnother rope tied like a noose was discovered Wednesday at the site in Windsor, about 10 miles (16 kilometers) north of Hartford, prompting an intensified law enforcement investigation and calls by the state NAACP on Thursday for the suspect or suspects to be brought to justice.\n\nAmazon said in a statement that it is closing the site until Monday so that additional security measures can be put in place.\n\n“We continue to be deeply disturbed by the incidents happening at the construction site in Windsor,” Amazon said. “Hate, racism or discrimination have no place in our society and are certainly not tolerated in an Amazon workplace.”\n\nWindsor police said they are working with the FBI and state police.

The IRS has announced that prior to sending the first batch of partial monthly payments, it will open two online portals for parents with qualifying dependents. The portals can be used to register (for those who don't normally file a tax return), to update information like a change in the number of children and to opt out of the monthly payments. We'll tell you what we know below.\n\nThe 2021 advanced child tax credit payments will go out on the 15th of the month, with each check for as much as $300 per dependent or $3,600 in total, based on the age of the child by the end of the year. Parents should be aware of the income limit and other requirements to get the full payment.\n\nWe'll be updating this story regularly to explain the separate IRS portals as we receive more details. Here are some different ways to use your child tax credit checks, how you may receive your payment and how you can claim an additional $8,000 to $16,000 credit for child care expenses.\n\nWhat will the IRS' online child tax credit portals let you do?\n\nTaxpayer families will be able to make changes to any life circumstances since they last filed their taxes, such as an income change and child custody status. For example, if you started making less money this year, you'll want to update the IRS about those changes so you can get the correct child tax credit amount.\n\nIf you had or will have a new baby this year, it's important to let the IRS know, so you can receive your payment for up to $3,600 for that child. The same applies if you adopted a child or if you gained a new child dependent since you last filed your taxes.\n\nAlso, if you've gained full custody of your child, you'll be the parent who receives the money for your kid. Note that parents who have shared custody will not each get a payment. This is important for domestic violence survivors, Nina Olson, executive director of the Center for Taxpayer Rights said during an IRS oversight hearing. \"That change of circumstances portal should allow them to enter their change in marital status and also where the children are.\"\n\nWhen will the child tax credit portals open for eligible families?\n\n\n\nThe IRS has set an open deadline of July 1, though we don't have an exact date yet. The portals could come online sooner than that. The IRS is simultaneously processing tens of millions of tax returns, which may affect the timeline while it also organizes the child tax credit program.\n\nCan the child tax credit portals be used to opt out of monthly payments?\n\nThe main portal will let you opt out of receiving the monthly child tax credit payments. What does that mean? It means that instead of receiving monthly payments of, say, $300 for your 4-year-old child, you can wait until you file your 2021 taxes next year to receive the $3,600 lump sum amount.\n\nYou may also want to opt out because you're expecting your circumstances to change and don't want to update your information in the portal.\n\nWhat about parents who don't normally file taxes?\n\nThe IRS will open a second portal dedicated to people who don't typically file their income taxes. This child tax credit portal will allow this group to give the IRS their updated information, including the number and ages of their qualifying child dependents.\n\nThe portal is expected to let tax nonfilers submit a simplified electronic form to the IRS to secure their eligibility. This group would include people who don't have bank accounts, as well as the homeless population.\n\nWhat about those who don't have a permanent address?\n\nRight now, the IRS is urging people to share information about the child tax credit to those who don't have permanent addresses. By doing this, you're helping make sure eligible people receive the payments they're eligible for. You can share the information about the portals with them so they know about the programs to help them file a tax return.\n\nWhat we still don't know about the child tax credit portals \n\n\n\nThere are still plenty of details that are still unclear about the IRS' child tax credit portals, including:\n• The exact date the portals will be available to families.\n• How the portals will work for families updating their information.\n• How families will differentiate between the two portals.\n• The process for opting out of the monthly payments.\n\nFor more child tax credit 2021 details, here's how much money you can expect to get. Also, here's what it takes for you and your dependents to qualify for the payments.","114":"(Bloomberg) -- Daimler AG’s truck chief expects hydrogen-powered big rigs to play an important role in slashing emissions from the transportation sector despite the technological hurdles and skepticism raised by two prominent rivals.\n\nFocusing solely on battery-electric vehicles would be risky because of the scarcity of certain raw materials and challenges grids will have supporting wide-ranging charging networks for trucks and buses, Martin Daum, Daimler Truck’s chief executive officer, said in a phone interview.\n\n“We cannot afford to bank on just one technology to reach the climate goals,” Daum said. “The focus until 2025 will be 100% on battery-electric vehicles. Between 2025 and 2035, we’re going to need both battery-electric and fuel cell vehicles because the massively growing infrastructure requirements require a two-legged approach.”\n\nFuel cells, which generate electricity from hydrogen and therefore eliminate the need to recharge batteries, have been touted for years as a potential alternative to combustion engines. But high costs and sparse fueling infrastructure have stood in the way of broader adoption and left the technology far behind battery-electric powertrains in the passenger-car market.\n\nElectrifying commercial vehicles is more complex -- they’re larger, heavier and used for everything from deliveries to supermarkets in urban areas to long-haul transport in remote areas. Daimler recently formed a joint venture with rival Volvo AB to jointly develop fuel cell stacks.\n\nWhile prominent industry leaders including Tesla Inc.’s Elon Musk and Volkswagen AG’s Herbert Diess have repeatedly criticized fuel cells and argued battery power is the only way forward, Daimler and Volvo aren’t alone in seeing long-term potential.\n\n“Decarbonization of the energy mix represents the most profound shift in energy since the start of the industrial revolution,” Sanford Bernstein analysts led by Neil Beveridge said in a note to clients. “It is simply impossible to reach net zero by 2050 without hydrogen playing a major role.”\n\nDaimler’s truck division is the world’s largest maker of commercial vehicles and on track to be spun off from the Mercedes-Benz luxury-car operations this year. The split reflects the diverging technology trends between passenger cars and commercial vehicles. Both will need enormous investment in new technology to comply with stricter emissions standards.\n\nDaum, 61, mapped out more aggressive profitability targets on Thursday and objectives to generate the funds needed to navigate the industry’s transformation.\n\n“We want to be a resilient company that can avoid losses even in difficult years,” he said. The unit plans to list at the Frankfurt stock exchange later this year and could enter the country’s blue-chip DAX Index.\n\nDaimler boasts a truly global footprint that’s unique among commercial-vehicle manufacturers. While Volvo just trimmed its presence in Asia by selling its UD Trucks business in Japan, VW’s Traton SE unit is finishing its takeover of U.S. truckmaker Navistar International Corp. next quarter.\n\nApart from Mercedes trucks, Daimler’s trucks and buses division comprises Fuso in Japan, BharatBenz in India, Setra in Germany; and Freightliner, Thomas Built and Western Star in North America.\n\nThe company has relied heavily on profits from Freightliner in recent years, as North America tends to generate much of the industry’s earnings. Executives said Thursday that boosting profitability at European operations will be a top priority and pledged to reduce personnel and material costs to become more competitive in the region.\n\nAsked whether Daimler may consider an acquisition of CNH Industrial NV’s Italian business Iveco, Daum said his focus is on the company’s own operations. “I don’t see the need for us to add an asset to our European business,” he said. “There are no plans for any structural changes.”\n\nMore stories like this are available on bloomberg.com\n\nSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.","115":"Based on data compiled by Credible, current mortgage refinance rates end the week at record lows, unchanged compared to yesterday.\n\nRates last updated on May 21, 2021.

(Tasos Katopodis\/Pool\/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nSenators Urge Biden to Reverse ‘Disastrous’ Decision to Give COVID-19 Medical Tech and Intellectual Property to China\n\nA number of Republican senators are urging President Joe Biden’s administration to reverse its “disastrous” decision to give U.S. COVID-19 medical technology and intellectual property to China under a controversial “Trips waiver.”\n\nThe Trade-Related Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPs) waiver was first proposed by India and South Africa, and would suspend intellectual property protections for products and technologies needed for the fight against COVID-19, including vaccines, for the duration of the pandemic.\n\nOn May 5, U.S. Trade Representative Trade Katherine Tai released a statement on behalf of the administration which voiced support for the TRIPS waiver.\n\nHowever, more than a dozen Republican senators have now voiced their concerns over the controversial waiver, stating that it would do nothing to end the global pandemic and would instead “foster uncoordinated vaccine nationalism.”\n\nSens. Roger Wicker (R-Miss.), Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), and Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) sent a letter to Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo and Representative Tai on May 20, asking them to reverse the Biden administration’s decision to support the proposal.\n\nIn the strongly-worded letter, the senators argued that the waiver would undermine the “nation’s global leadership in the technologies, medicines and treatments of the future” and “provide a boost to the Chinese Communist Party’s ‘vaccine diplomacy’ and enable Beijing to undercut American leadership on vaccine distribution throughout the developing world.”\n\nThey noted that countries such as China, India, and South Africa had “falsely claimed” that the waiver would speed up the development of new vaccine capacity, and pointed to a lack of technological capacity in the supply chain as the underlying reason as to why there are not currently enough vaccine doses.\n\n“Vaccine production is a complex technical and logistical process, with limited technical resources (e.g., skilled scientists and technicians at companies). At best, all President Biden’s giveaway to China and India and others will do is foster uncoordinated vaccine nationalism, as countries jump in to try to coerce technology transfer and manufacturing locally,” the senators wrote in their letter.\n\nThe letter was signed by 13 other Republican senators.\n\n“It is not surprising that China, India, and South Africa want to steal our intellectual property and medical technology,” the senators continued.\n\n“What is surprising is that an American president, especially one who claims to be a ‘jobs’ president, would force American companies to give their medical technology and manufacturing processes to foreign adversaries like China. Simply put, the Biden Administration’s support for a TRIPS waiver puts America’s interests last and China’s interests first.”\n\nThe senators noted that they have several “serious concerns” over the Biden administration’s support of the waiver, and demanded to know how the president had reached this conclusion.\n\nThey asked that the administration answer a string of questions by no later than June 19, 2021, including what evidence the administration relied on to conclude that intellectual property was a barrier to vaccine manufacturing and that the benefits of waiving intellectual property protections outweighed the potential costs.\n\nThe senators also want to know whether Chinese leader Xi Jinping asked the administration to grant the waiver when he spoke with Biden in March, how the waiver would be implemented, and whether private citizens would be denied their ability to protect or enforce intellectual property rights in U.S. courts.\n\nOther questions include whether or not the Biden administration plans on waiving American intellectual property laws and intellectual property enforcement, including enforcement against intellectual property and trade secret theft.\n\n“Under this scenario, what would happen if a Chinese national is found to have stolen trade secrets? Under the waiver, if adopted, would they not be prosecuted? And, what of the Chinese nationals currently being prosecuted? Would those cases now be dropped?” the senators questioned.\n\nRep. Earl L. “Buddy” Carter (R-Ga.) also showed his support for the letter on Thursday, writing on Twitter that the controversial waiver was a “gift to China.”\n\n“The Biden Admin’s support for waiving IP protections for COVID-19 vaccines is a gift to China who has spent the past year trying to steal our IP, goes against our patent system and will stifle innovation of lifesaving drugs and cures by removing the incentives for investment,” he wrote.\n\nIn his first speech to Congress in April, Biden touted U.S.-China relations, specifically intellectual property as of one his administration’s key issues.\n\nThe president vowed to continue to “stand up to unfair trade practices that undercut American workers and American industries, like subsidies to state-owned enterprises and the theft of American technology and intellectual property.”","118":"Five years ago, Illinois lawmakers passed a law that boldly aimed to build a solar power industry from scratch while also saving thousands of jobs at two struggling Exelon nuclear plants.\n\nBesides bailing out the nuclear plants, the Future Energy Jobs Act promised to create tens of thousands of solar power jobs and get the state moving away from fossil fuels to a point where, by 2025, Illinois would be getting a quarter of its power from “clean energy” sources.\n\nThings haven’t worked out as planned. The 2025 target is now far out of reach, the jobs expectations went unmet, and the solar industry is laying off workers as the funding that was promised has dried up, an investigation by Inside Climate News and the Chicago Sun-Times found.\n\nThe plans the law promised sputtered from the start.\n\nNow, state legislative leaders are racing to meet a May 31 deadline to fix its biggest problems — including the impending loss of more than $300 million in funding for renewable energy programs.\n\nWhen environmental groups, unions and consumer advocates came together to support the law, they found common ground in marrying nuclear subsidies with support for renewable energy.\n\nBut it was Exelon that emerged as the clear winner under the state’s bold clean energy plan. It got $2.3 billion in subsidies funded by electricity customers over a decade for its two plants.\n\nAnd now the company is demanding even more money — and threatening to close two other nuclear plants if it doesn’t get what it wants.\n\n“Exelon continues to get $235 million a year, while the solar support has been stripped away,” said Howard Learner, executive director of the Chicago-based Environmental Law and Policy Center, who’s been a critic of the state’s nuclear bailout. “Illinois could’ve been a Midwest solar energy leader.”\n\nComplicating the current scramble is the ongoing federal bribery investigation of Exelon and ComEd, its Chicago utility subsidiary. Prosecutors have said ComEd gave cash, jobs and contracts to associates of former House Speaker Michael Madigan, D-Illinois, with the aim that he would shape the legislation to the company’s benefit.\n\nMadigan, who has said he’s done nothing wrong, hasn’t been charged with any crime, though people who were in his inner circle have been. He resigned in February.\n\nGov. J.B. Pritzker has said Exelon won’t be allowed to dictate terms for fixing the state’s energy law. But the company and its labor allies have immense power in the Legislature.\n\nExelon is seeking subsidies for its four Illinois nuclear plants that didn’t get help under the 2016 law and threatening that its Byron and Dresden nuclear plants will close without that aid.\n\nMeanwhile, solar companies are laying off workers following the end of incentive funding tied to the 2016 law.\n\nSupporters of the law talked of a coming boom in solar jobs. But the gains have been modest. Illinois went from 3,480 solar jobs in 2015 — 14th-most among all states — to 5,259 jobs in 2020, which ranked the state 13th, according to the Solar Foundation. a not-for-profit organization “dedicated to advancing the use of solar and solar-compatible technologies worldwide.”\n\nThough few new solar jobs came to Illinois, there has been a surge in the small-scale solar projects that the law aimed to encourage, with more than 20,000 such projects completed.\n\nBut solar remains a blip in Illinois’ energy landscape. It provided less than 1% of the state’s electricity generation in 2020.\n\nSolar and wind energy have grown in Illinois, but such renewable sources still account for only about 7.5% of the state’s electricity consumption, far short of the pace needed to reach the 25% that was targeted by 2025.\n\nSome of the problems are specific to Illinois’ political culture. But they also touch on national concerns about how to increase renewable energy while preserving the jobs and carbon-free electricity from older nuclear plants.\n\nExelon maintains, as it did in 2016, that it would shut down the nuclear plants if it considered only financial factors but that the preservation of carbon-free electricity and jobs is so important that the state should consider every option for keeping the plants open.\n\nIn a written statement in response to questions, Exelon says the 2016 law won broad support because “it was, and remains, a good framework for comprehensive energy policy.”\n\nLast year, Illinois got 58% of the state’s electricity from Exelon’s nuclear plants. The company says that closing them would leave a void that largely would end up being filled by electricity from fossil fuels.\n\nComEd spokeswoman Shannon Breymaier said the law “has delivered on its goals of spurring new investment to develop renewable energy, expanding energy efficiency programs and dedicating funding to new programs that train workers for clean energy jobs and help utility customers reduce their bills.”\n\nNational environmental groups including the Union of Concerned Scientists and the Natural Resources Defense Council have said they support subsidies for nuclear plants to keep them from closing prematurely.\n\nAs their support suggests, much of the criticism of the Illinois law isn’t about the nuclear subsidies but, instead, the taint from the bribery scandal and concerns that the renewable-energy provisions were severely underfunded.\n\nIn 2016, Exelon was threatening to close its Clinton and Quad Cities power plants and wanted Illinois lawmakers to require utilities, including ComEd, to charge consumers for a 10-year subsidy for the plants.\n\nAt the time, environmental groups, clean energy business groups and environmental justice advocates had their own proposals.\n\nMadigan, who won’t comment now, made clear that any clean energy proposals needed to go through Exelon.\n\n“Being able to pass clean energy legislation was conditioned by the speaker to reach agreement with ComEd and Exelon and labor,” said Jen Walling, executive director of the Illinois Environmental Council, which led the push for renewable energy provisions.\n\nWalling, whose group represents more than 90 environmental and community groups in Illinois, said Madigan’s stance forced environmental advocates to work with Exelon.\n\nFormer Gov. Pat Quinn, a Democrat who held that office from 2009 until he lost a 2014 re-election to Republican Bruce Rauner, said the process was unseemly but typical for Exelon.\n\nExelon wanted “the renewable people to literally crawl to them,” Quinn said. “As long as they could hold up the renewables and the progressive stuff, they’d get more for themselves.”\n\nFederal prosecutors have said ComEd’s actions at that time were an element in a pay-to-play environment for energy legislation in Illinois, with ComEd giving cash, contracts and jobs to people connected to Madigan. The investigation has led to indictments and a deferred-prosecution agreement for ComEd.\n\nBreymaier said ComEd has “substantially strengthened oversight and controls of its lobbying and hiring,” among other steps to prevent actions like those described by prosecutors.\n\nThe legislative debate included talk of social benefits on a grand scale.\n\n“We are going to create tens of thousands of jobs around the state of Illinois, in communities of color but also for our brothers and sisters downstate and the rural economy,” then-state Rep. Christian Mitchell, D-Chicago, said of the promise of the solar program.\n\nMitchell, who’s now Pritzker’s point person on energy and the environment, didn’t respond to a request for comment.\n\nOther than the nuclear bailout, the 2016 legislation had provisions requiring utilities to increase the amount of in-state renewable energy they buy, with funding of about $225 million a year.\n\nThe law included requirements to encourage energy conservation, with each utility having to expand energy-efficiency programs and meet certain goals through 2030.\n\nUtilities also got some big benefits that were not widely known, including the ability to expand a loosely defined “smart grid” modernization program that began in 2011 and allowed utility companies to raise rates — and increase profits.\n\nThe grid modernization has led to $4.7 billion in added costs for ComEd customers since 2012, with little evidence the money led to substantial benefits for consumers, according to a report in December from the consumer group Illinois PIRG.\n\n“Any interests of ComEd or Exelon are not left up to chance,” said Abe Scarr, the organization’s director and co-author of the report. “They are guaranteed.”\n\nBreymaier said the spending tied to the grid modernization has been vetted by regulators and improved the reliability of ComEd’s system while maintaining unusually low electric rates compared to those found in other big metropolitan areas.\n\nOn Dec. 7, 2016, then-Gov. Rauner signed the landmark energy bill into law.\n\nHe did that at a high school in Port Byron, a small town near the Quad Cities nuclear plant that would get subsidies.\n\n“While this legislation isn’t perfect, it allows us to protect jobs, ratepayers and taxpayers,” Rauner said.\n\nExelon had only a short wait to start getting paid. It began receiving the bailout money in early 2018.\n\nBut state officials spent nearly two years drafting and implementing procedures for the clean energy provisions of the bill. That took time because the state was setting up a process for how to decide which companies would get the limited funding. And the office in charge, the Illinois Power Agency, had fewer than 10 employees.\n\n“These are complicated programs,” said Anthony Star, the agency’s director, who said the small staff wasn’t an issue. “You can’t just turn them on overnight.”\n\nOne of the centerpieces of the clean energy provisions was what was called an “adjustable block program,” designed to dramatically increase customer-owned solar power.\n\nSolar entrepreneurs saw this as an attractive deal, especially for community solar projects, providing a nearly guaranteed profit for developers and discounted electricity for consumers.\n\nThe first round of applications in 2018 turned into a feeding frenzy, with projects far outnumbering the available funding.\n\nAs developers vied for the limited dollars, a much bigger flaw emerged with the way lawmakers had set up the funding. Money for the renewable energy programs came from a charge on customer bills of about $1.15 per month for households, more for businesses. The charges provided for funding that turned out to be far short of what was needed to get on track to reach 25% renewable electricity by 2025.\n\nCustomers began to pay the charges in mid-2017. The money accumulated for about two years while the Illinois Power Agency was designing the programs and selecting the first projects. After those began to get money, many developers were slowed by delays related to the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nThe state agency was making decisions based on the idea it could spend all of the available funding. But the projects were coming online so slowly that there was going to be a large unspent balance as of May 31, 2021 — the date the law set for when any balance would be returned to customers as a refund.\n\nAs of late 2020, the agency had committed all of the projected available money and had none to give to projects on the long waitlist for funding.\n\nAnd the agency was facing the loss of the ability to use some of the money utilities already collected, but not paid, to other projects because the unspent balance was set to go back to utility customers. As of March, the projected balance of unpaid money was $352 million.\n\nIllinois now is facing the consequences of what went wrong with the 2016 law. Lawmakers are working to do something about that by May 31, the final day of the legislative session and the deadline to fix the solar funding.\n\nExelon is threatening to move forward with plans to close the Byron and Dresden nuclear plants if the Legislature doesn’t approve additional aid.\n\nAmong the people who suffered most from the missteps were clean energy entrepreneurs and their employees, many who'd decided to go into the renewable energy industry because of the attention surrounding the 2016 law.\n\n“This year is probably going to be our toughest year,” said Dawn Heid, chief executive officer of Rethink Electric, a solar installer in the Chicago area. “There is a severe cliff in front of us.”\n\nHeid’s company grew from four employees to 70 employees to respond to demand from the solar programs — and then it laid off dozens when the new projects came to a near-stop because of uncertainty about funding.\n\nEven if the legislature comes up with a stable, long-term plan for supporting renewable energy, the state’s credibility on these matters has been damaged, said Josh Lutton, chief executive officer of another Chicago-area solar installer, Certasun.\n\n“If you want businesses to invest in Illinois, you can’t encourage them to invest and then say, ‘Ooh, we really didn’t mean it,’ ” Lutton said.\n\nClean energy advocates defend many aspects of the law, saying the ideas were good, even though some programs were hurt by funding problems.\n\nWill Kenworthy, Midwest regulatory director for the advocacy group Vote Solar, said there are now more than 20,000 rooftop solar and community solar projects that have been built or are in the works, most that wouldn’t have happened without the law.\n\nThe 2016 law “was imperfect,” Kenworthy said. “But it was fixing an even bigger mess. In some ways, it was a resounding success.”\n\nLawmakers have said they are optimistic they can reach agreement on a bill and pass it by May 31, providing new funding for renewable energy.\n\nPritzker has proposed “measured, short-term state support” for the Byron and Dresden nuclear plants but said Exelon no longer is calling the shots.\n\n“The days of Exelon treating Illinoisans as their piggy bank are over,” a spokeswoman for the governor said.\n\nBrett Chase’s reporting on the environment and public health is made possible by a grant from The Chicago Community Trust.","119":"\n• Elon Musk's influence over the crypto market won't last forever, Vitalik Buterin said.\n• He doesn't think the Tesla billionaire's support for dogecoin has any disagreeable purpose.\n• Ether's nosedive this week means Buterin may have lost his crypto billionaire status.\n• Sign up here for our daily newsletter, 10 Things Before the Opening Bell.\n\nVitalik Buterin, the 27-year-old co-creator of Ethereum, told CNN this week that he doesn't think Elon Musk's tweets promoting dogecoin are suspicious.\n\n\"Elon Musk tweeting is something that the crypto space has only been introduced to for the first time literally last year and this year,\" Buterin said. \"I think it's reasonable to expect a bit of craziness. But I do think that the markets will learn. Elon is not going to have this influence forever.\"\n\nMusk has turned the spotlight on dogecoin after hinting that the meme-inspired cryptocurrency could be used to make payments towards Tesla. On Thursday, he tweeted \"how much is that Doge in the window?\" along with an image of what appeared to look like a one-dollar bill with the meme-famous Shiba Inu dog.\n\n\"The fact that he is a 100-plus billionaire, and he runs Tesla and SpaceX and all these things doesn't change the fact that ultimately he's a human - and humans get excited about dog coins. That's just a thing that humans get excited about,\" Buterin told CNN. \"I don't think that Elon has a kind of malevolent intent in any of this.\"\n\nRead More: 7 crypto heavyweights told us what's behind the sudden sell-off that erased over $400 billion from the market in just 24 hours - and whether now is the time to 'buy the dip'\n\nThe crypto market plummeted this week after Tesla halted bitcoin payments. Bitcoin fell as much as $30,000, while Ethereum's ether and dogecoin lost more than 30% each.\n\nEther's decline to around $2,708 per coin means Buterin may have lost his status as the youngest crypto billionaire for now. His Ether address, which he disclosed on Twitter in 2018, showed a balance of about $888 million as of Friday, down from around $1.1 billion on Wednesday.\n\nBut he isn't fazed by the dramatic sell-off, and even acknowledged the market could be in a bubble. According to the entrepreneur, it's \"notoriously hard to predict\" when bubbles could burst. \"It could have ended already,\" he said. \"It could end months from now.\"\n\nOn bitcoin's energy concerns, Buterin said resource consumption is huge. \"It's not the sort of thing that's going to break the world by itself, but it's definitely a significant downside.\"\n\nHe thinks the crypto community will call for a transition to a less energy-intensive technology, or expects bitcoin to get left behind if it sticks to the way it's currently produced.","120":"SEOUL—South Korea has a wealthy-country solution to alleviate its delayed rollout of Covid-19 vaccines: propose a swap with the U.S., which has one of the world’s biggest supplies.\n\nWith its president visiting the White House on Friday, South Korea is expected to suggest an exchange of millions of doses on a one-for-one basis: The U.S. provides vaccinations now from its growing pile of unused shots.
